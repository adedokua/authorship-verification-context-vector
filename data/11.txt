"Well, I"d say it"s an oasis," Link answered sarcastically. Katt sighed heavily, "Thanks a bundle for your help." "Come on, we"re almost there. We"ll find out more in detail when we arrive," Link suggested. And so they began to walk again, for a long time. The trees did indeed appear close by, but so did Mount Chaos off in the distance, and we know that it wasn"t near at all. In due time, they were close enough to see exactly what the ring of trees concealed. "Link..." Katt said. Link turned to her and saw that she was holding the Shield of the Elements in her hands, "Look, the topaz is glowing." Indeed it was true. The orange-yellow gem was glistening brighter than the other jewels. "I guess the temple is somewhere inside that... place," Link concluded. "Yup, but there"s no doubt that this place has high security. We have to be aware of everything around us," Katt silently approached on of the gigantic trees, and peeked around the side, into the civilization that dwelled inside. "Wow!" Katt said softly, but full of expression... expression of happiness. "What is it? What do you see?" Link whispered to her, as he walked over. However, he got no response, "Katt?" he stared at her... something was different. "I must be the happiest Gerudo in the world," she commented giddily with stars in her eyes. "What is with you?" Link wanted to shout, but knew he had to be quiet. Katt slowly lifted her hand and pointed to what dwelled inside the ring of trees; A colony of Gerudo... men, "I would so be willing to wait a hundred years for one of these cuties." "Katt! Snap out of it!" he waved his hand I front of her face. Katt shook her head, "Woah... sorry about that. It"s just that it"s nice to see so many guys that don"t look like Ganondorf." "You are a sad, little, desperate Gerudo girl," Link observed. "Yeah, yeah," Katt muttered, "But look at them! They"re perfect! How can you not find them perfect?" "You know, I"m thinking it"s because I"m more interested in GIRLS." "Good point," Katt credited Link, "But how are we going to get in there without being spotted and without me going crazy and hitting on all of them?" "Well, I don"t know about the second one, but I think we can sneak around, but you may have to injure some of your sweethearts." "OK!" Katt grinned. Link was silent for a moment, "I am just glad that you don"t like me." "And that you should!" she winked at Link, "How are we going to do this?" "Well, if these guys go down as easy as..." Link changed his sentence as he caught Katt"s glare, "The same way as the Gerudo of Hyrule, then all we need to do is shoot them with an arrow." "Simple enough," Katt agreed while pulling an arrow out of its quiver, "Let"s get started, shall we?" Link pulled out his bow, "OK, let"s go!" While remaining concealed, Link and Katt swiftly launched arrows at each of the Gerudo guarding the castle in the centre of the oasis. Katt always saying something like "I"m sorry, my darling!" after each arrow was launched. Everything was going fine, until Link tripped over a rock and fell into one of the (refreshing) pools of water. All of the Gerudo that were still in tact, turned to the direction the splash came from and captured Link. Katt has stayed hidden during the commotion, and was now left with the responsibility of rescuing Link. "Oh, what am I going to do?" Katt was once again leaning against one of the giant trees, just outside of the oasis, "They must have taken him into the castle... I have to get in there... Senkrad is depending on it... the Deku Tree is depending on it... Link is depending on it... those hunky Gerudo are depending on it! OK, that settles it! I have to take my risks! I told Link that risks would be necessary, and now it"s time to prove it! In I go!" Katt slipped through two of the large trees and entered the oasis once again. This time, she did not bring harm to any of the Gerudo... she was alone and did not want to draw attention to herself. Katt sidled along the castle walls and slid into the first doorway she found. "Link," Katt whispered as she navigated the empty paths. It was so empty and spacious that even her soft whisper echoed. But she wasn"t about to take the chance of someone hearing her shouting "LINK!' Oh, no one"s here... she leaned against the stone walls with her hand, and her hand seemed to sink into the wall, "AH!!" she couldn"t resist screaming as she fell through the wall, "Ugh..." she got to her feet and observed the area. "Good job, Katt," she heard a voice mutter from across the hallway. It was Link, sitting in a dungeon, as she was. Katt turned around and saw that iron bars now covered the wall she had fallen through, "Well, I got further than you did." "Fair enough," Link agreed. "Do not speak in my dungeon!" another voice interrupted the conversation, "This is not a place for socializing. You have both intruded the sacred Gerudo Oasis." The heroes turned and saw a Gerudo approaching them. Unlike the other Gerudo, whom all appeared dark, this one was wearing orange that matched his fiery hair. "I am Mordred, leader of Senkrad"s Gerudo tribe. Do you have any excuses for entering my kingdom?" he asked, looking straight at the dungeon pathway ahead of him, refusing to look Link or Katt in the eye. "Yes, Your Highness," Katt attempted to gain Mordred"s trust, "We do not mean to intrude, but simply to aid the oasis, and all of Senkrad at that." "What help do I need?" Link erupted, "Well, in case you haven"t noticed, genius, this land is a little dark! We"re here to help you all by killing the damn evil!!" Katt heaved a sigh. Link had pretty much blown the chance of Mordred getting along with them. "We have been living this way for centuries. There is no way that two strangers can help us now." "Yes we can," Katt pleaded, "Please... we know what we are doing. We have already begun to restore peace, by completing the task in Deku Plain... please, allow us to destroy the evil of the Oasis Temple." Mordred was beginning to be annoyed, "No one may enter the Oasis Temple!" he turned to Katt and finally had a look at the threat of his kingdom. All darkness seemed to have left his eyes, "You... are... one of us..." "Huh?" Katt blinked. "You are the female Gerudo of legend! Destined to save us with the companionship of the little-elf-boy!" "Little-elf-boy?" Link clenched his fists, "Companion? She"s the one helping me!!" Mordred ignored Link"s outburst, "I apologize," Mordred put his hand through the cell bars and held Katt"s hand. "Erm..." Katt tried to shift away. "Please, allow my people to aid you in any way we can." "Uh... sure," Katt was a little freaked out, "Start by letting go of me and releasing both my friend and I... uh... please?" "Most certainly," Mordred agreed. He took out a key and opened the cells that held Katt and Link, "You must both be tired from your journeys. Let us go and have a great feast to celebrate the beginning of our freedom!" "Yay! Food!" Link shouted excitedly. "What about you, heroine? Do you wish to join us?" Mordred asked Katt. "Yeah... I go where Link goes," Katt answered. Mordred looked confused, "But why would you follow your companion?" "Again with the companion!?" Link exclaimed, "SHE is the companion! I am the hero!!" Katt nodded in agreement, "Link has always been the hero of Hyrule." "Clearly there is much to be explained," Mordred stated, "We shall talk over dinner." And so Link and Katt followed Mordred as he led them through the castle pathways. *~* End of Chapter 11 *~* *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Poor, poor Katt. That Mordred is frightening... BWAHAHAHAHA!! *cough* Ahem... anyway, please review and let me know what you thought! I"ll work on writing more when I can! ^_^ I"m so sorry it took SO long to update!! I"ve had so much school work, other fan fics to work on and... of course... a fun writer"s block. (-- Insert sarcasm here) Well! Here"s the next chapter! Enjoy!! *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* The Legend of Zelda: Dark World *~* Chapter 12 - A True Ally *~* Link stuffed his mouth full of the food Mordred had served, "This evil Gerudo stuff isn"t half bad!" he said with a mouth-full of food. "Watch your manners, Link," Katt said, embarrassed. Mordred laughed, "Please, do not worry about it! I have seen much worse manners!" but his soon instantly changed from carefree to serious, "Now... you must explain to me what this "journey" of yours is." "Oh yeah," Link remembered, "Where is the temple??" he stood up and slammed his fist on the table. "Link! Why are you acting so... not like yourself?" Katt asked, a little lost for words. Link was silent in thought for a moment, "You know what? You"re insaneness is rubbing off on me!" he brushed off his arms, "I feel unclean..." Katt rolled her eyes, and then noticed Mordred"s blank expression, "Oh! Sorry, Mordred! We still haven"t explained why we"re looking for the temple. You see... we"re on a quest to destroy the dragon - as we"ve mentioned - But there"s more to it than just going and killing it... there"s a whole spiritual thing involved." Link sat back down, "I"ll take it from here... There are these five pieces of a dragon statue, one in each of the five temples across Senkrad. If we get them all, we should be able to defeat the dragon. So that"s why we need to get to the temple in this oasis." "I see..." Mordred nodded in understanding, "Well, you"re in luck! It just so happens that I"m the one who can get you into the temple!" "Go figure..." Katt muttered. Mordred stood up and motioned them to follow, "Come on. We have no time to lose!" Link and Katt obeyed, and followed the dark Gerudo. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ "We have arrived!" Mordred held his arms out, showing the... temple? There was not a thing there... only a small lake. "Um... Mordred..." Katt began. "Yes?" "Where"s the temple?" "Here." "Where?" Link joined in. "Right here!" "I don"t see it," Katt insisted. "Well, of course you don"t!" Mordred stated. Link and Katt simply blinked in reply, "I suppose that you just don"t understand..." Link and Katt nodded in agreement, "Well then, perhaps you will understand now..." Mordred knelt by the lake and chanted some words in a language that Link and Katt could not comprehend. As if replying to Mordred"s strange words, the ground begun to shake. Link and Katt struggled to keep their balance as a gigantic building rose from the water. Once all was settled, Mordred got to his feet, "Now do you see?" "Kind of hard not to..." Link said, staring at the temple. "Indeed," Katt agreed. "Well then," Mordred began, "I suppose you ought to enter it... but before you do, please, take this with you," he held out a glass bottle... but the glass was black and opaque. "What is it?" Link asked. "You"ll find out when the time is right," he said in reply, "Open it when you are one hundred percent that your opponent is more than you can handle," he handed the bottle to Katt. "Thanks..." Katt stated with a confused tone in her voice. "Don"t worry," Mordred assured, "You"ll know when it is necessary to be opened. Now go. The temple awaits you." "Good-bye, Mordred! And thank you for your help!" Link called as he entered the temple, followed by a silent Katt. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ The second that they stepped into the temple, their obstacle was apparent... "AH!!!! What the hell is this blinding light!?!?" Katt shielded her eyes. Link did the same, "I have no idea... the first temple was dark, and this one is light..." "Do you think that if I open the bottle..." Katt began before she was interrupted by Link. "NO!!" he protested, "As much as I"d like to believe that we"d be able to see clearly if we opened that bottle... it isn"t the right time yet." Katt sighed, "Yeah... I know..." They stood in silence for a moment, deep in thought of a way to navigate through the dungeon. Suddenly, a faint chattering echoed through the room, "Link..." "Yes?" "Do you hear that?" ".... Yes." "What is it?" "I... don"t know..." Link scanned the area - but the radiance was keeping him from spotting whatever was out there. He thought that he could see something moving within the light; however he was not certain, until... "Link!! Boes!!" Katt cried. She lifted her sword and swiftly let it fall directly in front of her - the shriek of a boe alerted any creature dwelling in the dungeon that opponents had arrived. "Boes...' Link thought back to his adventures, and the small, ghostly creatures that dwelled in Woodfall and Snowhead, "Not good...' boes blended in perfectly with their environment. Their colour and texture made them practically impossible to spot... but their glowing eyes gave them away. Link charged his blade and used the "spin dash" technique to take out a large group of boes. It seemed that as the boes were defeated, the light faded... "Katt! Keep killing boes!" "Gotcha..." Katt understood Link"s command. She pulled out her bow and armed it with an ice arrow. Katt released the string, sending the arrow flying toward a cluster of boes. Once they were frozen solid, she finished them off with her sword. Link and Katt continued their techniques until the room was dimmed and the boes were defeated. Link took a deep breath after knocking the last boe down, "Finally..." he look around the room - it was huge. There was no door in sight. No path. No escape... "Great... what do we do now?" "Check this out!" Katt was kneeling over what appeared to be a small tide pool, "This pool is deeper than it looks..." she dangled her fingers in the water, "It"s narrow, yet seems endless..." Link observed it over her shoulder, "There seems to be an underwater tunnel," he stated, "Go in and check it out!" "What?! Why me?!" Katt objected, "You need to come in, too!" "Yeah, I know," Link shoved Katt into the water, "I"m right behind you!" he jumped in after her. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ Link pulled himself out of the water and joined Katt on the sandy shoreline. The area that they were in truly appeared as an oasis. The sand of the desert beneath their feet, but many trees and other various plants surrounded them. They both took a moment to catch their breath before speaking again, "So what"s this place?" Katt shrugged, "How should I know?" "Because you"re a smartass know-it-all," Link said in response. "No... I"m just a Gerudo," Katt mocked her own race. Link couldn"t help but laugh. It was true. Any and all of the Gerudo that he met were know-it-alls. "Hey, Link. We need to get out of here; and I see the way," she pointed toward a door on the other side of the room; however there was a lock keeping them from passing through. "Uh huh... but do you see any ways that we can actually get through?" Link asked in the tone of an adult trying to bribe a child. Katt snarled, "No." "Well, I think that I do," Link got to his feet and walked over to a growth of vines attached to a wall, "Check this out," he slashed at the plant - revealing a hidden pathway, "Follow me!" he called back to Katt as he headed through the tunnel. Katt obeyed and followed. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ Drip... drip... small droplets of water fell from the leaves of the trees. Link and Katt stepped cautiously into the small room. It seemed quite desolate. "Well this was a waste of time," Katt said, "There"s nothing here to help us get through that door." Link opened his mouth to comment... but stopped when he heard a rustling in the trees above them. He looked up and noticed a shadow leaping from tree to tree. "...Link?" Katt tilted her head in confusion. "Ssh!" Link covered Katt"s mouth and proceeded watching the shadow in the trees. It soared through the air, and landed in front of the warriors. "A... Keaton...?" Link asked himself aloud. The dark fox-like creature in front of him seemed so much gloomier than the bright and wise Keaton of Termina, "I am glad that you remember me, Link." "Wait... you"re THE Keaton that I met in Termina!?" Link exclaimed. The Keaton nodded, "Much like a storm, I travel wherever the world guides me. I was sent to Senkrad... something in my mind told me that it needed my help... and it does... it needs my help to be put out of its misery!" "What are you saying?" Link could not believe the words coming from the Keaton"s mouth, "You"re not like this. Keatons want to help!" "And that"s what I"m doing," the beast insisted, "There is no more hope... so I am helping by ending it." Katt, who had been silent, finally put in her opinion, "That isn"t helping. What Link and I are doing... that"s helping. Not even trying to fix things is basically sentencing this world to ruin!" "Then so be it..." the Keaton charged at Katt. Without hesitation, Katt reached for the bottle Mordred had given her, and opened it. A light escaped, and assembled itself on the ground. It took on the form of a mask... a mask that resembled the face of the Keaton... only it was yellow, and not black. Link shot Katt a "what are you doing!?' look. But she simply motioned toward the Keaton. Link obeyed her signal, and turned his attention toward the Keaton. It was slowly approaching the mask with fear in its eyes. The Keaton looked down, then held its own paw in front of its eyes, "I am not... myself..." it said at last, "This isn"t me... that is..." it examined the mask. It sat down and placed its left paw on the mask, "What have I done?" "There"s still hope for you," Katt knelt down by the Keaton, "You can become yourself again, and help us..." she picked up the mask and held it in front of the Keaton"s face. A brilliant light shone for a moment, and then evaporated into the air. During that split second, the Keaton had been restored to its original state of hope. "Thank you, warrior," the Keaton said, "You have saved me from the darkness of this world. It engulfs nearly all who enter it... but somehow, you have both escaped it. I am Xyghan. Thank you... both of you." "There"s no need to thank us," Link said, "It"s all part of getting through the temple." "No!" Katt broke in, "There"s more to it than that. If we had the help of you, Xyghan, this quest would..." "Wait a second!!" Link dragged Katt away from the Keaton, "Are you crazy? Don"t you remember what Rio said? "Only a handful of people can be trusted, and you will be fine without their help.'" "Well, if you ask me... Rio wasn"t doing so great living by those rules. Link, if Xyghan has been in this temple for basically as long as he"s been in Senkrad, then he can help us find our way through!" "But Katt..." "Just trust me on this one," Katt assured, "Plus, if all else fails, we can kill it." "Fair enough..." Link gave in, "All right, Keaton. You can travel with us." "Good," Xyghan said, "Because you wouldn"t get much farther without me," he turned and bounded toward one of the trees. Reaching into the tree"s hollow with his paw, Xyghan pulled out a key. He nudged it towards Katt, "Here. We need this key to get through the door of the previous room." "Oh... so THAT"S where that key was..." Link gave a fake smile. Katt smirked, "Wow... that"s some awesome skill there, "Hero of Time"." "Quiet, Katt," Link said. "Actually," Xyghan joined the conversation, "Link is indeed a great hero, Katt. He saved Termina from the evil Majora"s Mask. There is no denying that he will not save this land, as well." Link grinned triumphantly, "Thanks, Keaton!" he headed back toward the room he and Katt had formerly been in. Xyghan followed. Katt stood behind for a minute, "Seriously... Where the hell is Termina!?" she shouted after them. No reply. Katt growled under her breaths, "Idiots... Hey!! Guys!! Wait for me!!" she chased after Link and Xyghan, so they could continue their adventure through the Oasis Temple. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Hooray!! I am FINALLY done this new chapter! Oh, and mastershadow64, the name Katt has a history with me. It"s from some old video game for SNES... Can"t remember the name, though. o.0 Anyway... for as long as I can remember, "Katt" has been my code name in video games, etc... Right, so... PLEASE review and tell me what you think of this chapter and the rest of my story! I will try to update as soon as I can!! With Christmas vacation soon, it should work out! OK, Link enters. Something you"ll understand (I hope so. o.0) Um... yeah. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* The Legend of Zelda: Dark World *~* Chapter 2 - The Forest"s Outsider *~* "You will go on another journey... An adventure... But you will not go alone... You will have a companion to aid you save the world..." Link"s eyes opened. He sat up on his bed and looked around his small house, no one was there. it was dead silent. "Just a voice of my dreams," he said to himself. "LINK!!" "Woah!" startled by the yell, Link fell off of his bed, "What a way to start the day..." he muttered, getting to his feet. "Link! Will you get your lazy arse down here!!" the voice called again. Link walked through the doorway into the bright sunlight of Kokiri Forest, "Saria... give me a break... it"s too early for yelling..." he said, rubbing his eyes. "Too early?" the green-haired girl said sarcastically, "Look above you! The sun"s at its high point! It"s past noon! Anyway, there"s no time for this argument today. An outsider has entered the forest!"
