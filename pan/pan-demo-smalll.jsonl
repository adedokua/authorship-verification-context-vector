{"id": "c04fdf1e-ddf5-5542-96e7-13ce18cae176", "fandoms": ["CSI: New York", "Four Brothers"], "pair": ["\"Calm down, Nicolas. You don\"t wanna do something extreme.\" Stella said calmly. \"I already have. What\"s one more body!\" he said. \"Another 10 years.\" I told him. I glared at me. \"This is your fault.\" he told me. \"No its not. Its no ones fault. The rookie made a mistake. And how do you think he felt? He knows it was him that fucked up.\" \"Good.\" \"Then why go after me and Natali!?\" I yelled again. \"Because you\"re happy. You cant be happy. You don\"t deserve her. You can protect her. We wen through this already. You worthless. You love her like I loved my wife and now you\"ll get to feel what its like to loose that.\" He said pulling her closer to the edge. I was so relieved when I saw Don, Mac and Stella walk through the door. He hadn\"t hurt me but he didn\"t let me make a move. I tried to talked to him but he knew what I was trying to do. Reverse psychology. He wouldn\"t let me. After they got there I was able to talk to him for a few. He honestly believe that Don was to blame and that\"s when I got even more scared. Mac tried to talk to him and even Don tried to put in a few words. But I knew he wasn\"t buying it. He wanted to show don what it felt like to loose someone you love but me and Don weren\"t in love. We were barely dating. Yeah we had feelings for each other. But we weren\"t too sure how deep they went. \"Nicolas. Me and Don don\"t love each other. We\"ve known each other two months. We\"re barley dating. We\"ve only had one date and it was ruined because of you\"re killing spree.\" I told him. He shook his head. \"No. I can see it. Whether you two can or not I see it. Its there you just haven\"t grasped it yet.\" he said to me. \"I agree.\" Mac stated. I looked at him confused. Everyone knew that we loved each other except us. What the hell?! \"You see it too?\" Nicolas asked him. Mac nodded. \"Told Don that earlier. She\"s good for him. I know how it feel to loose your spouse. I lost mine in the 9/11 attacks. And as mad as I was I would never wish that on anyone. Its too painful. Why would you want that for Don?\" he asked. \"Because he needs to feel it.\" \"No one needs to feel it. What would your wife say? How would she react to you doing this?\" Mac asked. I felt his grip loosen. \"I don\"t know. But it doesn\"t matter. She\"s gone.\" He walked closer to the hole in the wall. He turned me to face him. \"Tell her I said I miss her.\" He said that and pushed me. I tired to grab onto him or anything but I wasn\"t quick enough. As I fell out the hold I was Don running and screaming toward me. Thanks for reading. Please review...It makes me happy! And don\"t forget to check out the CSI:NY FanFiction Awards. It is so worth your time. Sorry it took so long. I usually get my chapters out pretty fast but I had my SAT today so I was studying. So here it is. Hope you like it! Don\"t forget to leave me a review...good or bad. I take criticism well. I watched as he pushed her toward the hole and I ran. I saw her try to reach for some thing to hold onto but failed. I got to the hole as her hands were slipping off the sides. I grabbed her by her forearm and pulled her up. She was sobbing by the time she put her feet on the ground. She sat between my legs and sobbed into my chest. I looked over and saw Mac cuffing and cursing at Sventinski. Stella ran over to us and rubbed her back as the paramedics ran up the stairs. She looked as if she barely noticed the EMT\"s checking her out. They took her down to the ambulance and took her vitals. \"We\"re going to take her in just in case. Her vitals are a little elevated so we\"re going to check her out and probably give her something to calm her down. I nodded and walked over to her. She tried to stand up from the bumper of the ambulance but sat back down. \"You\"re going to the hospital, ok? They wanna check your vitals longer and maybe give you something to calm you down.\" \"Come with me?\" She asked. I went to tell her I couldn\"t when Mac walked up and answered for me, only his was different. \"Yes. He\"s going with you. I\"ll finish up here, Don. Go with her and make sure she\"s okay.\" I nodded and stepped up into the ambulance as they were about to leave. She was quiet the whole way to the hospital. She didn\"t even move. The EMT said it was probably shock and that they would give her some sedatives at the ER. We got to the ER and they put her in a room. She sat on the bed and looked out the window. \"I\"m sorry.\" I told her. She looked over at me. \"For what?\" She asked softly. I walked over to ger and sat with her on the bed. \"For getting you in this mess. If you hadn\"t met me, you wouldn\"t be here.\" She grabbed my hand and gave me little smile. \"Well, if I hadn\"t met you I wouldn\"t have had that awesome kiss the other day. So, as long as I get another one, there\"s no need to apologize.\" She looked better as she said this. I smiled and leaned into her. I paused for a second to see if she would pull away but when she didn\"t I brushed my lips against hers. I pulled back and she smiled. I moved closer and held her face as I kissed her again. Her hands went around my neck and pulled me closer. I ran my tongue across her bottom lip and she opened her mouth. The moment out tongues touched an bolt went through my whole body. I kissed her harder and deepened the kiss. Her hands were running through my hair as we were interrupted again. I pulled back to see Mac smiling. \"Wow! Flack\"s blushing.\" Danny said coming in next to him. Mac slapped him in the head. \"Leave him alone, Dan. I said make sure she\"s feeling okay, but this isn\"t what I had in mind.\" He said looking at me. \"So you\"re okay, Natali?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Don\"t call him sir, miss.\" Danny tried to joke. We all stared at him. \"I thought it was funny.\" He said to himself and rubbed his head. I shook my head and laughed. \"Well, yes she\"s fine. Her vitals are good and they ended up not giving her meds. So now we\"re just waiting to get the release papers.\" I told them. Mac nodded and looked at Natali. \"You still going to stay with Flack?\" She looked at me and I answered for her. \"Yeah. For a few more days at least.\" A few minutes later the doctor brought us the release papers ad we were on our way back to my apartment. We order take out and sat in the living room until it arrived. \"Thanks for letting me stay again.\" She told me. I looked over at her and smiled. \"No problem. You can go back to your\"s when we release it back to you.\" I told her as I got up to get the door. I paid for our food and carried it back into the living room. We sat on the couch eating Chinese take-out and watching MadTV. \"I was hoping our next date would be better than just take out.\" I joked. She laughed and threw her plate away. She came back and laid on the couch. Her feet in my lap. I looked at them and back at her. \"What am I a footrest?\" She smiled and shrugged. \"No. What if I don\"t want your nasty feet n my lap?\" I asked. She tried to pull away but I grabbed her feet and looked at them. I smiled at her as she begged me to stop. \"Don, please! Don\"t tickle me.\" She pleaded. I looked at her and them back at her feet. My smiled got bigger as I laid her feet down, one on either side of my body. I crawled up between her legs and hovered over her. \"Why you\"re no fun tonight.\" I joked. She smiled and leaned up to capture my lips in a hot kiss. I leaned down closer and her arms wrapped around my neck. My hands went to the bottom of her shirt and snuck their way onto her silky skin. I felt her shiver beneath my fingers and moved them up farther. I broke the kiss and moved to her neck, kissing and nibbing it lightly. She moaned as my lips sucked on the spot just under her ear. I kissed my down to her collarbone and moved down to her stomach. I pushed the shirt up and kissed around her naval and up to her ribs. I pushed her shirt up the rest of the way until it was on the floor beside us. I ran my hands up her near naked side and made my way to her back to unclasp the bra. I kissed the top of her breast lightly before taking her nipple between my teeth. She moaned and ran her fingers through my hair. I sucked and nibbled gently before pulling away and pulling my own shirt off. In an instant her hands were on my chest and my skin tingled at the sensation of her running her fingers down my chest and stomach. I moved back up to find her lips in yet another smoldering hot kiss. I felt her wrap her legs around my waist and I ran my hands down her legs. I held her hips steady as I lifted us off the couch. She squeaked and I laughed. \"I\"m not going to drop you, don\"t worry.\" That seemed to satisfy her because she went back to kissing me. I carefully made my way to the bedroom and threw her on the bed. She shrieked again but before she could get a word out, my lips were on hers. She leaned back onto the pillows as I began to undo her jeans. I pulled them off and took the time to take in the woman before me. \"You are too beautiful.\" I whispered as I ran my hands slowly up her legs. I turned them in as I got closer to her thighs. I looked up to see her biting her lip and shifting a bit. \"You okay?\" I asked. She smiled and nodded. I gave her a smile and leaned down to kiss the inside of her thigh. She gasped a little and shifted more. I smiled and gripped her hips. I moved my lips higher and kissed the soft fabric of her underwear. I kissed my way back up the middle of her stomach and chest to her lips. It was more heated than ever. I felt her fingers trail down to my pants. She unbuckled my belt and then unzipped my pants. Before I could reach down and pull them off she pushed me over and crawled on top of me. She leaned up and whispered in my ear. \"Think you\"re the only one that gets to do the teasing?\" she asked me seductively. I grinned and bit the side of her neck, this time not so gently. She pulled my pants of and sat directly on top of me. I held in a moan as she leaned down to kiss my stomach just above my boxers. She ran her hands up my torso and slowly kissed her way up, nibbling her way up. I moved my hands to her hips and held her in place above me as I flipped us over. She pouted as I grabbed her wrist and pinned them above her head with one hand. I reached down and pulled her panties off. I ran my fingers ver her opening and she moaned out loud. I removed my boxers and positioned myself between her legs. I grabbed a condom from the drawer and rolled it on. I bent down to kiss her and slowly entered her. I felt her arch against me and she moaned into my mouth. I moved within her as my hands roamed her body. She ran her hands over my back, digging in lightly as I pumped faster. I buried my face in her neck and kissed her softly as I thrust faster. God, she was perfect. I never wanted it to end but it was coming quick. I felt her tighten around me and I thrust harder. She repeated my name over and over again and tightened her legs around my waist drawing me in deeper. She dug into my back and let out a scream as she came. I came only a few moments later muffling my own sounds of pleasure in her neck. I rolled off of her and tried to catch my breath. \"Getting old detective?\" she teased as she curled up next to me and made invisible circles on my chest. I laughed and kissed her head. She smiled up at me and leaned up to kiss me. It was soft and sweet. I could see the sparkle in her eyes as she pulled away. \"You\"re not that much younger than me. Five years. You\"ll be here in five short years.\" I retorted still looking at her. \"What did Mac mean earlier?\" she asked setting her chin on my chest and looking up at me. I closed my eyes and sighed. \"When he told me he told me so?\" She nodded. I smiled and probably even blushed a little. \"Tell me. You said it was nothing bad. So tell me.\" she insisted. \"He told me that you reminded him of Clair. He said that we reminded him of them when they first started dating. He told me to be nice and maybe you\"ll stay.\" I joked at the last part. She smiled. \"Seriously, he told me to try to keep you around. Said you\"re good for me.\" She leaned up and kissed me deeply. She pulled back a little. \"What was that for?\" \"Keeping your promise.\" I smiled and pulled her in for another kiss. This one was long and passionate. I felt something different that time. I couldn\"t tell what it was but it felt right to be with her there. We broke and looked in each other\"s eyes. \"Come on. It\"s been a rough day. Let\"s get some sleep.\" I told her. She nodded and laid back down next to me. I lifted my arm as she curled up to my side again. She laid her head on my chest and I wrapped my arms around her. Even after the events of that day it felt normal to be with her. I looked down at her to see she was already asleep. I watched her for a few minutes thinking about what Mac had said to me. She was beautiful and smart. Most of all she trusted me with her life. She had made that clear today. A few minutes later I was falling into the best sleep I had in months maybe even years. Ok, well I hope you liked it. If it\"s short, I\"m sorry. I\"m kinda tired from my SAT today. R&R, please. And...don\"t forget to check out the CSI:NY FanFiction Awards!! It\"s worth your time, trust me! Sorry this chapter is so short but it\"s all I wanted to put in it. The dream at the end will be explained in the next chapter. Well, I hope you enjoy it. Please, review and tell me what you think. Don\"t forget to check out the CSI:NY FFA. It\"s worth it, trust me. Loads of awesome stories and writer\"s getting recognition for the talent they have. Thanks! The next two months flew by and my graduation was three days away. I was still at Don\"s apartment. Don\"t know why but I was. I went there to get clothes each week but that\"s about it. My apartment manager had stopped me from paying rent because he know what I had gone through and he was convinced I\"d be living with Don soon. Well, technically I was but that\"s a discussion we hadn\"t had yet. Today was big day. My whole family was coming down. Well, my parents, brothers and their families and my little sister. And well, they wanted to meet Don. Of course, when Don mentioned that my family was coming down they thought it\"d be a good idea to have a cookout so they could all meet. To say the least, me and Don wished we were kidnaped right about now. \"Please, tell me we can cancel.\" I groaned as the sun hit my eyes. He groaned and mumbled into his pillow. \"What?\" I asked. He lifted his head a little. \"No.\" And he laid his head back down. I smiled and sat on his back, gaining a groan. I started to massage his shoulders and the groan turned into a sigh. I slowly felt the tension leave his muscles and I smiled to myself. He rolled over underneath me and brung me down to lay on his chest. \"Morning.\" he said sleepily. I kissed his chest and looked up at him. \"Good morning.\" He pulled me up to kiss him and I put my hands on his face to kiss him back. We were just about to deepen the kiss when my cell rang. I sighed and dropped my head on his chest. I leaned over to the dresser and picked up my phone. \"Hello?\" I answered yawning. \"Hey, darling! It\"s mom.\" my mother said. I rolled my eyes and rolled off of Don, him pouting the whole time. \"I know, mother. What do you want?\" I asked. \"Well, someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.\" she joked. I looked around and actually I had. I usually sleep on the right side, this morning I woke up on the left. \"Yeah, I guess I did.\" I mumbled. \"Well, are we still on for today? The cook out?\" she asked. \"Yes, mother. I told you that yesterday.\" I sighed. \"Ok good. I can\"t wait to meet Don and his family.\" she said excitedly. \"Yeah, ok mom. Well, I have to go. I\"ll see you later.\" I hung up and rolled over to look at Don. He was still pouting. I laughed and kissed him. \"Come on. The shower gets lonely.\" I leaped out of bed ran after me to his bathroom. A few hours later we were dressed and heading to the park where we were having the cookout. We arrived to see a slew of cars parked outside. We stayed in the car and stared. Don leaned against the wheel and looked out to the gathering. \"Okay, so maybe we can leave.\" he said moving his hands toward the keys in the ignition. I grabbed his hand and opened me door. \"Please? We can say we got caught up with something.\" He pleaded as he got out the car. I was about to say something when two little kids came running up to Don. He smiled and picked the girl up. \"Uncle Donnie!\" the girl squealed as she kissed his cheek. I smiled. \"Julie, James this is Natali. Nat, this is Julie and James, two of my many nieces and nephews.\" he introduced me. They all had the same eyes. Blue like Don\"s. \"Hello.\" I smiled leaning down to the boy. He smiled shyly. \"Are you Uncle Donnie\"s girlfriend?\" he asked. I smiled at him and nodded. He squealed and ran off with Julie right behind him. I looked over at me and shrugged. We walked to the gathering and I saw my parents. The next hour was full of hello\"s and how are you\"s. Don had introduced me to his parents, his brothers and sisters and their families. They all had those blue eyes and Don was the spitting image of his father. And of course I had introduced him to my family. All the kids were playing on the playground with mine and Don\"s mom watching them and talking. Our father\"s had crowded around the grill and were talking about sports. Don was talking to his brothers and brother-in-laws and my brothers and brother-in-laws. While I was with the rest of the girls. It was like high school again. Everyone had their own groups. I didn\"t want to admit it but I had fun. It had been almost two hours and I hadn\"t talked to Don once. But we kept sneaking glances at each other, most likely to make sure the other was still alive. I was talking to Bridget when Don came over. \"Sorry Brig, but I gotta steal her for a moment.\" He said sweetly grabbing my arm and pulling me to the cars. I could feel people looking at us and whispering. \"What do you think they are talking about?\" I asked. He stole a glance over his shoulder and smiled at them. \"Probably about the seating chart at our wedding cause we sure as hell will have a big family if we ever get married.\" he teased. I laughed and nodded as we sat on the bench near his car. \"Well, nice to see you again. Been a while, huh?\" \"Yes! I thought I was going to get eaten alive but I managed.\" I smiled at him and he sat behind me, one leg on each side of me. He moved my hair to kiss the back of my neck. I smiled and intertwined our fingers. I laid his head on my shoulder and looked at our families as they mingled. \"I like you family. They\"re nice. Reminds me of my own. Your mom\"s too cute.\" He told me. I nodded. \"Yeah, I love her. God, knows she bugs the hell outta me but I\"d be lost without her. They get along very well, our families. You dad\"s funnier than I though he\"d be.\" \"Yeah, don\"t know where it comes from. It still surprises me.\" I leaned back into him as he kissed the side of my neck under my ear. \"Think you\"d ever consider marrying me?\" he asked. I smiled. \"If you keep doing that I will.\" I laughed as he kissed my neck more. He pulled back and tilted my head to look at him. I smiled and he leaned down to kiss me. It was long and soft, with just a little bit of lust in the back. Just as the kiss deepened we were interrupted. \"Stop molesting your girlfriend in front of our families, Donnie.\" Bridget smiled and looked at us. \"I\"m not molesting her. I\"ve never done anything she didn\"t want me to and that should probably count as her molesting me.\" he teased. Bridget let out loud laugh and I hit him upside the head. \"Donnie!\" I yelled. A few other family members saw this and laughed. \"Ah, she\"s already got him in his place.\" His dad laughed and patted me on the back. About another hour later people were starting to disappear and we thought it was our time to go. We left and drove to his apartment. We got inside and instantly went to the bedroom. We flopped down on the bed and sighed. I opened my eyes to see Don staring at me. \"What?\" I asked scooting closer to him. \"It wasn\"t that bad, right?\" he asked. \"No, it wasn\"t that bad. But I have a major headache now. Too many kids.\" I laughed. He smiled and pulled me to him. \"Do you want kids?\" he asked. I nodded. \"Yep. I love kids. I want like three. At least three and at least a boy and a girl.\" I told him. \"Me too. I\"d like a boy and a girl but more than two. I want te best of both worlds, raising a girl and a boy. Let me do all the boy stuff with my son and be all protective over my girl.\" he confessed. \"Aw the big bad detective has a soft side.\" I teased. He pinched me and laughed. \"Yes, I do but don\"t tell anyone. I mean, I want a family. A wife to come home to after a long day. Kids yelling and screaming all over the place. Call me crazy but I\"d like that.\" he said. \"You\"re not crazy. I want that too.\" I said softly. \"Preferably that wife being you.\" he whispered in my ear. I smiled and turned over to face him. I leaned up to kiss him. \"I\"d like that too.\" He smiled and kissed me back. We fell asleep not too long afer that. At first it was peaceful but suddenly I woke up and screamed. Don jumped up and held onto me.", "call her la vida loca. She jumped up, pulling me with her and ran to the door. \"Yeah, yeah. Come on!\" she yelled and bolted out the door. I watched her jump into her car and I smirked. \"Bobby is going to have a field day.\" BREAK The whole way Angel shot me glares and I started to find it amusing. He was my brother but he was pulling it for Emilie. I found it kind of ironic. We pulled up to the lawyer\"s house and I nodded my head. \"Nice place.\" I whispered as we walked around to the back. \"We might have to spend the night up in this bitch.\" Bobby joked cracking the back window and reaching in for the door knob. \"An attack dog.\" he said and looked a the tiny white ball of fur on floor. \"Come here, poochie. You don\"t wanna bite me, do you? You gonna bite me, baby?\" Bobby cooed to the dog. I shook my head as we all spilt up to look over the house. I was a laptop on a desk and walked over to it. He was a lawyer so this must be important to him. \"Hey, Bobby, check this out. I found Bradford\"s calendar.\" I said pulling up his calendar. \"You don\"t think '\"EM\"' stands for Evelyn Mercer, do you?\" I asked them as they crowded around me. \"You\"re getting good at this, Jackie.\" Bobby mumbled, still holding the dog. \"November 21st. He met up with her the night she died. Why would anybody meet up with their lawyer at 8 at night?\" Angel asked. All of a sudden a loud and shrill voice filled the quiet night and I snapped the laptop shut. \"Angel!\" Sofi yelled from outside, honking the horn. \"Nice. Your girlfriend\"s here.\" Bobby said waving his hand around. I gave Angel a dirty look and Jerry dropped his head. This was great. \"She\"s crazy, man.\" Angel mumbled looking out the window at his girlfriend honking the horn. \"Well, go shut her up then.\" I yelled at him. \"Angel! Angel, come out! I see you in the window! Come out, you idiot! I know you\"re in there!\" she yelled. \"Y\"all come out here with me. This girl is crazy.\" Angel told us and we followed him outside. \"Angel! People, there\"s robbers in the house! Come out, Angel! I\"m gonna call the police now!\" she kept yelling to the neighborhood and honking her horn. We walked outside and Angel ran over to her. I didn\"t know until then that Emilie was there. She was us walk out and she got out the car. At first, I thought she was on Sofi\"s side but the big shit eating grin spread across her face and I knew. \"Come on!\" Angel yelled at her. We were all pooled around Sofi to get her back in her car that we didn\"t notice the lawyer driving up. \"You better call immigration on this girl.\" Emilie told us. \"You\"ve got a real class act here.\" Bobby told Angel. Oh, he was in for it. \"She should be at Guantanamo Bay.\" Jerry sighed. \"Locked up.\" I added in. \"Oh, my god.\" Emilie gasped. I saw her face pale and looked behind me. It was Mr. Bradford. \"Excuse me. What are you doing?\" he asked looking out his car window. Bobby walked over to him and Jerry followed, trying to keep him in check. \"How you doing, buddy?\" Bobby hissed and reached into the car. \"Bobby! Bobby! He\"s a lawyer!\" Jerry yelled. \"What\"s going on here?\" the lawyer asked. \"He\"s a liar, Jerry!\" Bobby yelled and threw the old man on the ground. Angel was finally finishing up with Sofi. \"Ain\"t nobody\"s business! Stay away!\" He yelled at her. \"You heard me, old man. You fucking lied to me.\" Bobby yelled pulling the lawyers sweater over his face, showing his stomach. \"You said you didn\"t even know my mother. You were the last person to see her alive.\" he yelled and smacked his stomach. \"Look at that, Jerry. It leaves a nice big red handprint, huh?\" Bobby smiled at his handy work, literally. \"Just ask him the question. Come on.\" Jerry said pointing to him. \"No, I\"m gonna do it again-\" he paused to slap him again. \"and again until I find out what I wanna know.\" he yelled. Angel walked over and reached over Bobby\"s shoulder to smack him once. \"Oh, God!\" he cried. Emilie gripped my hand and looked at me nervously. I rubbed her hand with my thumb and pulled her to me. I really wish she didn\"t have to see us like this. \"Tell him!\" Angel yelled. \"Okay.\" he whimpered and pulled his sweater off his face. \"Okay, I\"ll explain. It\"s just that I-I-I felt so guilty.\" he stuttered. \"Guilty for what?\" Jerry asked. \"I-I-I\"m not even sure I know how to say it.\" Bradford said looking around at all of us. \"Say what?\" Bobby demanded. \"Your mother and I were-Were seeing each other socially.\" he finally spit out. \"Socially?\" Bobby asked confused. \"I didn\"t want to sully your mother\"s reputation.\" he trailed off as Bobby helped him up. It was one big misunderstanding. \"She was a fine, fine woman.\" he complimented. \"I know. I know.\" Bobby sighed. \"I have some of your mother\"s night things, if you want.\" he started as Bobby helped wipe his coat off. \"What?!\" Bobby asked and stopped. \"They-\" Bradford started again. \"No. No, it\"s not necessary.\" Bobby said hurriedly. He, like the rest of us, did not want to hear about our mother\"s night things. \"Too much information. Ah!\" Jerry said disgusted as we all started back to the cars. \"I apologize, Mr. Bradford. We broke your back window. We\"re just trying to figure out what happened my mother.\" Bobby told him. \"I understand.\" Bradford nodded. \"Thank you. I appreciate that. You have a beautiful home here.\" Bobby told him and walked off. \"Thank you.\" he mumbled. Sofi and Angel went in her car back to the house while Emilie rode with me, Bobby and Jerry. \"She\"s crazy!\" Bobby exclaimed, driving down the road \"No shit Sherlock, where\"d you get your first clue?\" Emilie quipped. Bobby gave her a tiny glare in the mirror. \"Now why did you let her come here?\" Jerry asked. I watched her smirk and looked at Bobby. \"I just wanted to piss Bobby off.\" she told us. Bobby laughed and shook his head. \"Mission accomplished, Diddle.\" he told her. BREAK We got back to the house and every piled into their rooms. Jack looked over at me and smiled. \"You going home?\" he asked me. I shook my head and walked over to sit next to him. \"Nah, I\"m too tired to drive. I think I\"ll stay here. That okay?\" I asked, smiling up at him. He grinned and leaned down to kiss me. \"I wouldn\"t have it any other way.\" he whispered. I met his lips in a hot kiss and trailed my fingers down his chest to the hem of his shirt. He pulled away so I could pull it off and quickly moved back to me. He held my hips firmly and slowly moved his hands up, along with my shirt. I sighed against his lips as I felt my skin being uncovered by my shirt but being replaced with his skin. He stopped when it was under my bra and trailed his hand back down my stomach. My whole body ached to feel him as his hand found its way down the front of my panties. His lips were attached to my neck as he slipped two fingers inside me. I moaned and he moved his lips over mine. He moved his fingers faster and harder and I moaned into his mouth. My fingers curled around his hair and pulled it slightly. I smirked when he let out a moan. \"So Jackie likes pain.' I pulled it tighter and his fingers moved quicker. I felt his thumb come over me and start to rub slow circles, urging me even further. He kissed me with such passion and hunger I almost didn\"t feel the tingling in my stomach until the last minute. My toes curled, my breath caught and Jack held me tight, lisp pressed against mine, as my orgasm spilled over. When my body stopped trembling he removed his lips from mine and looked down at me. I smirked and pushed him over on his back. I kissed him as my hands went to work on his pants. I pulled them off and then let mine slid down my legs. I was wanting to take control but that was looking like it wasn\"t going to happen. Jack pulled my legs from under me and I fell, on my back, onto the bed. He crawled between my legs and smirked at me. I lifted his chin up and kissed him. I closed my eyes when I felt him rub against my opening. He attacked my neck and roughly thrust into me. Our first time was, of course, a loving tender one. But this time was the opposite. I had never seen Jack this way, not that it was bad. But he had always been gentle with me. I knew he was more experienced than me but I never knew it to this extent. But, don\"t get me wrong, I\"m so not complaining. His mouth covered mine again when I couldn\"t silence my moans. The last thing we wanted was for Angel to Bobby to hear us. They\"d kill Jack and well, I\"d just be embarrassed. I ran my nails down his back and felt him press himself to me more. I snaked a leg further over his waist and pulled him in deeper. It wasn\"t too much longer when I felt my second orgasm close in on me. This one strong and longer than the first. And Jack was right behind me with his. He pulled out of me and slid onto the bed next to me. I rolled over onto my side and laid my head on his chest. My hair sticking to his moist chest. We laid there in silence until we caught our breath. \"Emilie?\" he whispered. I looked up at him and he ran a finger over my nose. \"I love you.\" My heart stopped. Did he just say what I think he did? I looked at him again and looked into his eyes. There was no joke, no hurt in them. There was love and care. And the longer I stayed quiet the amount of embarrassment grew. I leaned up and kissed his lips softly. \"I love you too, Jackie.\" I whispered. Thanks for the reviews! I got ahead on this story, I have the next two chapters done...lol. But it was worth it. Now it\"s just the question of \"To kill or not to kill Jack.' ;) Thanks!! I woke up the next morning, after Jack had gone to get in the shower, and smiled at the ceiling. Last night was utterly amazing. He sang to me, he told me he loved me and he gave me a night I\"d never forget. Everything felt like it was falling into place again. It\"s just the only thing shadowing that was the whole drama over Evelyn\"s death. I knew why they wanted to find her killer. Especially, since they found out it was planned. I totally understood that. What I didn\"t like, though, was them going out every night chasing down bad guys with guns and knives. They could get killed and I often wondered if they knew that or not. And if they did, why they didn\"t think of how everyone else would react if the died. Leave it to bunch of men to not think things through and go out to get themselves killed. I crawled out of bed and grabbed a pair of Jack\"s pajama bottoms. I rolled the top hem down a few times to get them to stay on and opened the door. I smiled when Angel opened his door and gave me a tiny glare. \"Morning, Angel.\" I grinned and he shook his head. He walked in front of me to the bathroom and held his hand up at me. \"Stay there. Bobby\"s on the toilet.\" he warned me. I furrowed my brow at that. Wasn\"t Jack in the shower? Angel stood in the doorway and I leaned on the wall outside of the bathroom. \"Hey, Bobby.\" Angel called to him. \"Yo.\" was the low reply from Bobby. This was gross; they used the bathroom, talked and took showers with the door open. \"Hey, man. I gotta ask you a question.\" Angle said and cast a worried look my way. I rolled my eyes and pinched his arm. \"What\"s up?\" Bobby asked. Angel looked over at me and took one more step into the bathroom. \"You know me and Sofi did a lot of making up last night.\" he started. I rolled my eyes and leaned my head back onto the wall. I wish they\"d hurry. I need to brush my teeth. \"You gave her that ring, huh?\" Bobby asked and Angel chuckled. \"Gross!\" I yelled. \"Yeah. But it seem like I got a little rust on the tools down here.\" Angel mumbled slowly. Even though he was in the bathroom I could see him undo his robe. \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\" Bobby exclaimed as I laughed to myself. Guess their not that close. \"Ask the cockologist in the shower, man.\" \"Watch it, Bobby!\" I warned. \"Thanks, Em. How the hell would I know, Bobby?\" Jack asked from the shower. \"You\"re the expert.\" Bobby told him. \"Bobby!\" I yelled again. I heard all three snickers and then the shower curtain move. \"Rug burn.\" Jack said after a moment of silence. \"You\"re gonna live.\" Bobby declared. \"Thank God, man. I thought my luck ran out.\" Angel sighed and tied his robe back. He looked over at me and nodded. \"Hey, listen, man. You know, Jerry ain\"t been straight up with us about that redevelopment project. Found out his dream\"s dead. Jerry got involved with some bad people. City got on him about fraud and whatnot. Cut his loans off like a month ago.\" he explained. I didn\"t hear anything for a second and turned my head to the door to speak. \"Technically, Jerry\"s really broke.\" I clarified for Bobby. I heard the paper crumple and Bobby\"s chuckle. \"Thank you, Diddle.\" he laughed. \"You think this had something to do with what happened to Mom?\" he asked Angel. \"No, I\"m saying that it\"s something that we should look into. I need y\"all to go down and visit this city official named Douglas. He\"ll know who Jerry got mixed up with. I\"m gonna go check on some other shit.\" Angel told him. \"What are you talking about? Why don\"t you just tell me what you know, Angel?\" Bobby asked, sounding annoyed. \"I know you need to stay your ass on that porcelain. This is gonna require a little finesse. And given your prior reputation as a hothead-\" Angel told him and Bobby yelled in the middle/ \"I wrote the fucking book on finesse.\" he yelled. \"-you gonna be the first to fuck up.\" Angel finished. I heard the shower stop and smiled. Angel glared at me as he walked by and I gave him a sweet smile. \"I\"m gonna kill him.\" he muttered as he walked into his room. \"Wait for me to wipe my ass, Angel.\" Bobby yelled. \"I\"m coming with you. Angel! Get me some fucking toilet paper, Jack.\" he yelled. I laughed and smirked when Jack left the bathroom in a red towel. He grinned at me and grabbed my hips. \"Morning.\" he whispered as he pushed me backwards to his room. He reached behind me to open the door and pushed it open. He kicked it closed with his foot and pushed me onto the bed. I grabbed the towel as I fell and he smirked. \"Good morning.\" I smiled. I grabbed his wrist and pulled him down on top of me, our lips meeting immediately. I felt his hands move to my bottoms and that\"s when he pulled back. \"Hey, those are mine.\" he stated. I rolled my eyes and nodded. \"Yes, they are. Would you like them back?\" I asked sweetly. He was about to open his mouth when a knock came at the door. \"No need for you two to make up! Diddle, stay dressed. Fairy, get dressed. Now!\" Bobby yelled. I dropped back onto his bed and pulled a pillow over my face. I let out a scream and heard Jack laughing. I looked from underneath the pillow and frowned when he was dressed. \"We need to stay at my place from now on.\" I told him seriously. He chuckled and sat on the bed to put his shoes one. \"We can arrange that.\" he smiled. \"You want to come with us? You won\"t be in harm\"s way, I swear.\" he asked. I pouted and shook my head. \"I can\"t. I have a final today. I put it off as long as I could but winter break is coming up and if I want to get classes for next semester, I gotta take it today. Plus, I gotta do a few errands.\" I told him and he nodded. I moved to sit on his straddle his legs and snaked my arms around his neck. \"But you can come by my place when you get done.\" I smiled. \"Really?\" he asked. \"Yes, but bring some clothes. I just might keep you.\" I winked and leaned down to kiss his lips. \"I can live with that.\" he whispered as he pulled back. I slid off his legs and pulled him up. He gave me a quick hug and pulled back. \"I\"ll see you tonight.\" he smiled as he walked out. We drove to the parking garage outside of city hall and waited. We broke the back window of his car and poured gas all over it. Bobby had a thing for gas and fires. We waited off to the side so he wouldn\"t see us at first. \"So you and Emilie, huh?\" he asked. I smirked and nodded. \"Yeah, me and Emilie.\" I confirmed. I looked over at him as he smirked. \"Angel\"s gonna kill you.\" he told me. \"Thanks, Bobby.\" I laughed. I heard a door open and we looked around the corner. \"There he is.\" Bobby mumbled. We walked from our spot and rushed to get to him before he got to his car. \"Councilman Douglas.\" Bobby greeted as we stepped in front of him. \"Sorry to startle you. My name\"s Bobby Mercer. I believe you know my brother, Jeremiah? Apparently, you were the one who got his business shut down, right?\" he asked, not wasting time. \"This is not the proper venue for an appeal.\" Douglas told us and started to walk away. \"Look, we\"re not really concerned with that, councilman.\" Bobby said, as we closed the gap between us so he wouldn\"t go. \"I heard my brother got mixed up with some hoodlums. You know what I\"m talking about?\" he asked. \"I can\"t help you. Excuse me.\" he said and walked away. We smirked watching him walk to his car, not even noticing the broken window or smelling the gas at first. We didn\"t move until he froze and smelled his seats. \"Councilman!\" Bobby yelled pouring gas on the hood of his car. \"Now I gotta light your ass on fire! All I wanted was a name! You\"re gonna make me turn your ass into the black gingerbread man now!\" he yelled. I leaned down to look in his window and lit a cigarette. \"It\"s all right. I\"ll have my little brother here suck your burning dick.\" he yelled after throwing the gas can down. \"Give me the fucking cigarette.\" he said and snatched it from my fingers. \"Roll down the window.\" he demanded and held the cigarette out to the car. He reluctantly rolled his window down. \"Victor. Victor Sweet.\" he told us. \"What about him?\" Bobby asked. We waited patiently as he started to spill on his boss. By the time I had brushed my teeth, using Jack\"s tooth brush, and gathered my clothes, angel was already gone. I made sure to leave quick incase Sofi woke up and wanted to harass me. It felt weird going back to school even though it was for one class. They had given me a few days off for personal reasons and then it was already Thanksgiving holidays so it wasn\"t too big of a deal. But I missed one final test and I needed to take it before the rest of our winter break or I\"d have to take it over again. \"Hello, Miss. Ravin. How are you doing?\" Mr. Roberts asked as I walked in the near empty classroom. \"I\"m fine. Thanks.\" I smiled and took a seat up front. I looked around and saw a few people from my class but none that I talked to. I looked at the clock and sighed. 12:32. I needed to get this done. \"Okay you are here to take or re-take the Advanced Adult Psychology Final. Some of you failed and some of you missed it for other reasons.\" he told us and picked up the stack of papers. \"You have an hour to finish.\" he said and started passing them out. \"When you finish bring it up to me and you may leave. They will be graded sometime next week. I will either e-mail you your results or mail them out.\" he said and gave me the last stack. \"Now eyes on your own paper and-\" he looked at the clock. \"Begin. Time\"s up at 1:45\" I sighed and opened the first page. I was afraid I wouldn\"t remember anything because I hadn\"t been studying and honestly, almost forgot about school. The only thing that had been on my mind was Jack and all the things surrounding Evelyn. But my I guess I was just underestimating myself. The answers came to me easily and when I set my pen down I still had 35 minutes left. I smiled and handed my paper to Mr. Roberts. \"Thank you. You\"ll get them as soon as I grade them.\" he smiled. \"I\"m sorry about Evelyn. Is there anything I can do?\" he asked. \"Pass me? It would make her happy.\" I joked to show him I was doing okay. He understood and laughed. \"I\"m glad you\"re okay. I\"ll see you around campus, Emilie.\" he smiled and I walked out. I pulled my keys out and got into my car. I sat down and let my mind drift to the tiny piece of paper in the cup holder. I hadn\"t forgotten about it but whatever it was, it was big. And right now I didn\"t need anymore surprises. But my curiosity was getting the best of me as I pulled into the police station. \"Yes, can I help you?\" the lady at the desk smiled. I walked over to her and looked around. \"I was wondering if Detective Green was here.\" I asked. She smiled and pointed behind me. I turned to see him walking over to me. \"Emilie, how are you?\" he smiled. I smiled back and nodded. \"Pretty good. Caught up on some school today.\" I told him trying to act casual. \"Those Mercer boys staying outta trouble?\" he asked, grinning. \"Only in my dreams, Green.\" I laughed. \"What is it, Emilie?\" he asked getting serious. \"I need a favor.\" I started and before I could say more he lead me over to a corner cubicle and sat me down. \"Right after Evelyn died we went to her lawyer\"s office. He had a few papers for the boys and she had one paper for me.\" I told him. \"Mr. Bradford said it was a big surprise that Evelyn was waiting to give me. But it\"s just an address.\" I said and handed him the address. He looked at it and nodded. \"Want me to look it up for an owner? See if that helps?\" he asked. I let out a breath and smiled. \"Yes, please.\" I nodded and he logged onto the computer. He typed it in and got its information. \"It\"s owned by a Clarence Morgan. No word on if it\"s rented or what. Said it\"s been his for six years now. You know that name?\" he asked me. \"No. I don\"t recall it.\" I sighed. \"Do you even know anyone is Salem?\" he asked. \"I used to live there before Evelyn got me. I lived all over Massachusetts.\" I smiled."]}
{"id": "49dc4cae-3d32-5b4d-b240-a080a1dbb659", "fandoms": ["Final Fantasy VIII", "Escaflowne"], "pair": ["\"Squall!?\" Zell was panicking. Squall was moving toward the Sorceress, his gunblade was lax in his hand, too lax for him to be walking near an enemy. \"Firaga.\" A tornado of flame rage across the room and hit the Sorceress head on. A tall figure delivered a hard punch on the brunette\"s stomach knocking the boy out on the spot. Seifer sighed at the limp figure in his arm then at the enraged Sorceress who had pull up her defence in the last second with a wall of ice. Edea always loves Ice spells, the reason why she had Shiva for the longest time before she give it to Squall the day she was completely taken over by Ultimecia. \"You!? How dare you interferes!?\" The Sorceress hissed like a piss off viper when she finally taken a good look who had thrown the fire spell at her. Seifer merely arch an eyebrow at her anger, like he had done anything else in his life that made anyone who wouldn\"t get angry at him. \"Yeah, me, don\"t you miss me...my dear, dear...Edea...\" Seifer answer with a sing song voice. Even he nearly slipped in calling the Sorceress- Ultimecia. Zell scramble to catch the unconscious brunette when the taller blond threw the other at him. Seifer pull himself to his full high which Zell will never admit it even to the end of his days that, Seifer always scare him especially when he\"s all serious and menacing like a deadly predator going head on with a venomous viper. \"...Foolish...foolish Knight...I will remember this... \"The Sorceress hissed with venom as she slowly back through the portal she created and disappeared in a swirl of pink lights. To go against a full fledge Mage that could use master level magik was not something she would do with no back up...for now she will let them be but when they meet again she will make sure that bothersome White Knight won\"t be in the picture any longer. Watching the Sorceress disappeared with an expressionless face, Seifer hard press to stop the relief sigh that escape his lips. He really didn\"t look forward to fight Edea, not for who she was more than in the state he was in now, he don\"t think he could win the battle without some heavy consequences. The firga spell threw the Sorceress off into thinking he had mastered his magik but in truth, he barely have any spell more than level seven. His fire spell had always been the strongest even if he input the same amount of energy into any other type of spell due to his natural affiliation with the element his fire spell will literally explode anything they came in contact with if he pour enough magik to back up the spell. The blond turn and look at the rag-tag group of green mercenary and nearly groan at how disorganize they were. He glared back at the young woman who was throwing daggers at him since he knocked the puberty boy out. \"You know her.\" It was not a question but a statement. Quistis nearly yelled at the top of her lung. \"You knew the Sorceress!\" The former instructor was confused and the feeling of helplessness did not do her well. In the state her mind was now she could only take out her frustration on the only one who seems to know what was going on. Had the world gone mad now? Or was she having a very bad dream? You know who she is as well as I. Seifer wanted to say but he couldn\"t, not when he disrupted the things that should have been more than he should have already. \"Seifer? Is that you?\" Rinoa finally speak up from where she was hiding behind the group during the confrontation. The blond strike her with uncannily familiarity when he first appear rushing pass her to stop Squall from following that weird woman but as she keep on watching him...Seifer? Was he the same boy she had been with a few years back, in the darken streets of Galbaldia when she had first run away from her family? \"Hello to you too Rinoa, but this really isn\"t the time for chit-chat. The army is coming and I don\"t like to be thrown into jail and then be executed for not only attacking Deling but also attacking the Sorceress.\" Seifer ignore the gawking faces around him, he bend down and roughly push the chicken wuss aside and threw the unconscious Squall over his shoulder like a sag of potato and head toward the back entrance and away from the soldiers that was moving toward them. He paused by the door and glance back at the group that was merely gaping at him but still stuck to their spot. \"You guys coming or you would prefer to get caught?\" Like fire spell that had been light at their behind, the group chase after the blond who had a limp form drape over his shoulder and disappeared into the crowd of chaos that Timber had become. The board is set and the game begin...only this time the White Knight was settle with no rule... He was dreaming... flowing in and out as faces he felt he should know but couldn\"t place a name on blurring in the corner of his eyes... \"Wake up...my dear Knight...\" The voice of a stranger...even in the depth of his mind claimed that he knew her. \"Wake up...my dear Knight...\" He stirred but refuse to wake. \"Wake up...my Squall...\" \"There\"s no one the Turks couldn\"t \"wipe out\".\" The man once told him with expressionless face and cold eyes. The blond threw his head back and laughed slapping his hand on the man\"s shoulder and pull the stiff sorry bastard into the warm musky smell bar that they pass by. \"Calm down Vincent. I\"ll buy you a drink.\" And that too was all in the wash up past that shouldn\"t be... Seifer open his eyes and glance around the compartment they had claimed for the night as the train take them to the nearest Garden. A plan of action he had sworn up and down being a very bad idea but Quistis, her stiff by the book or you failed attitude was really getting to him. The blond rose from his spot by the door, a place he claimed, and a thought out action he always uses. The entrance truly was the only place in this compartment that will grant him a fighting chance if they were under attack... But from the vibes he got from the still sleeping group, it look like Ellone had caught up with them...but the Dream Sorceress\" power couldn\"t detect him... not when he\"s not where he suppose to be and who he suppose to be. On the other end of the compartment Rinoa woke up groggily and slowly crawl over the sleeping Selphie to reach for the blond she knew. .. \"Seifer? How are you? Why didn\"t you return any of my calls?\" The dark hair girl pouted and only got a side way glance from the blond man that didn\"t seem so arrogant as he was years ago but somehow darker...more calm...yet it only make him more dangerous to Rinoa who was always attracted to dangerous man. \"Away, tell me Rinoa, are you still the stuck up spoil princess that demand the world revolve around your little fingers like a well trained dog?\" Seifer sneered. He really was in no mood to deal with a current Sorceress wannabe- and he had any say in it, Rinoa wouldn\"t be getting Sorceress power any time soon. He pet absent mindly on Angelo who sat obediently by his heel and expose its throat for more petting. Angelo trust Seifer with blinding loyalty, for it, Seifer was the first image it saw when it open it\"s eyes so therefore the tall man was Angelo\"s \"mother\". He had let Angelo stay with Rinoa when they part ways couple years ago as a good willed gesture although he had never intended to train Angelo as a combat canine. \"Mooh, you\"re always so mean, Seifer. I did grow up.\" The girl pouted but stopped herself from getting too close from the look she\"s getting from the blond. \"Rinoa...I really don\"t want to kill you so please, stay out of my way from now on.\" Seifer said in a flat tone, a type of voice that didn\"t held any emotion yet anyone could tell he\"s dead serious about his threat. Rinoa back off. She might not be with Seifer for that long but she knew enough that right now the blond\"s patience was at its end and he was as calm as a volcano that was about to erupt with barest hint of provocation. She did not know what\"s had happen to the other when they part ways before but right now, her curiosity was peak as ever. If she got her way, her old flame will not just be her old flame when the ordeal\"s over. Irvine shook the sleep out of his head. He\"s having weird dreams again...well not so much as dreams than memories of the things that had long pass. Only tonight he really thought he had return to the orphanage and hanging out with a bossy blond boy who have a quiet brunette trailing after him every where he went... He hadn\"t dreamt of his childhood friends for a long time now especially when he had a few practise sessions with Guardian Forces... but this dream... \"Hye, Irvy, will you stop being such a slowpoke and get a move on! We won\"t wait for you forever! Come on! We need to get going!\" The dream Seifer had gesture him to come with Squally beside him twisting his hand in the blond\"s orange shirt and holding the stuff toy Ellie give him in another. \"Wait up! Where are we going?\" He heard his child self asked when he reached the two. \"To defeat our enemies!\" The blond hair boy said with a huge grin taking a hold of Squally\"s hand in one and his in another the two could only run along with the older boy before they were force to trip on their own feet. \"We\"ll be Knights and protect Matron together! No one hurt our families!\" He heard Seifer exclaimed in a loud voice and he couldn\"t help but felt the warmth that despite being unwanted by rest of the world, there\"s someone that still consider them to be family. He caught the eyes of the smaller brunette and there\"s something he couldn\"t describe in those smoky blue eyes when Squally watch Seifer laughing as he pull them into a run through the meadow. Not knowing what else to do, Irvine laughed along with the blond and with a smiling brunette beside them... His dream ended with him shot up from his cot in cold sweat. That\"s something else in his dream, like an ominous foreboding that made him feel like a little kid again fearing what\"s hiding underneath his bed. He shook his head and flopped back into his flat pillow and let his eyes close into a rest. He\"ll deal with it when it comes...for now, just let him have a good rest then maybe...maybe when he\"s head\"s cleared he\"ll know why in the world do he have this dream memory of someone he had not think about for couple of years now... An absent minded thought drift through but sleep had claim him before he could grasp it and by tomorrow morning he would not have remember it again. ...The look in Squally\"s eyes was very similar of the look of totally infatuation... \"God damn you! Hojo! He\"s just a kid!\" The wutaian man spare the raging soldier a glance through the corner of his glasses. He could not stand unwanted noises in his work area while he\"s doing one of his experiments. \"Seifer, if you continue on I\"m going to toss you out of my lab.\" The slender smaller man said in a blank monotone. The taller blond\"s glowing mako eyes stared almost sadly at the man he could no longer recognize. \"...What happen to you? He\"s your son isn\"t he? Why are you doing this to him?\" \"He was born for the solo purpose of bringing back Jenova.\" Seifer could not believe what he\"s hearing right now. Jenova The piece of mummified alien that Shinra dug out of the North Crater was the reason why Hojo ruin all of their lives for? First Lucrecia, then Vincent... \"...Will I be next?\" The question that slip out of Seifer\"s lips finally make Hojo look up from where he was tapping away on the computer and meet the other man face to face first time since the blond step into the room. \"You\"re already an experiment.\" Wake up Sunshine 03 \"...You seem to know awful \"lot of people, Seifer.\" Quistis came up to the blond man who was looking out of the balcony of the meeting. Debriefing with Headmaster Martin was over and they were only cleaning up the last minute paperwork and waiting for the return call from Balamb Garden. It had been a surprise for her when they got out of the wood track and arrived in Galbaldia Garden, she was first to talk to the Guards to let them know who they were and hopefully the other Garden would at least let them stay the night before they head back to Balamb. She wasn\"t prepare when the two Guards that was blocking the entrance to salute to the blond man that was trailing behind the group. And from the look of it, she wasn\"t the only one. Seifer merely nodded and wave his hand and tell the Guards to let them through and told them to let Martin know he\"ll be waiting in the master debrief. The way the two scramble to follow his order, it was almost like he held more authority over the Galbaldia Garden than the Headmaster himself. \"With the right connection, it\"s very easy to know people.\" Seifer didn\"t look at her, he knew what she was hinting but he wasn\"t in the mood to deal with this. Martin\"s attitude just not half an hour ago had made things more complicated. The older man was giving him uncertain glances every time the blond instructor gave a critical piece of what happen in Timber. How was he going to cover the fact that he is the second in command of the whole Galbaldia country now? Laguna better get his act together soon or else this \"Sorceress War\" will be out of control to a point he couldn\"t do anything to change the outcome... \"...Who are you?\" Quistis asked as she cross her arms over her chest. She had thought she knew her students but it seem she never really knew him. \"I am Seifer Almasy. Nothing more, nothing less.\" Seifer answered in flat tone. He is who he is, he is Seifer Almasy. The student of Balamb Garden. He is Seifer Almasy, the Second in Command of the Galbaldia Government. He is Seifer Almasy, Soldier First Class Soldier of Shinra. He is Seifer Almasy, the Knight that should have long dead instead of thrown back into a world he could no longer relate to... Quistis was interrupted by the incoming call from Balamb the whole room fell silent after they heard their newest mission. \"Are they nuts?\" Zell asked drily as he nervously pulled on his fighting gloves. Selphie was silent and Quistis had taken her glasses off and rub the bridge of her nose. Squall who had yet to say anything since they got off the train was staring at Seifer. And the say blond himself merely close his eyes and sighed. To assassinate the Sorceress...what kind of chance would they have to complete such impossible mission? Looked like there\"s no escaping this... \"Headmaster Martin, could you lend us a sniper.\" Seifer open his eyes and turn toward the older looking man. Martin nodded, he wasn\"t about to disobey the blond\"s order. He had seen first hand what kind of destruction the other could do...just say that those that had been at the last Parliament General Meeting had the first taste of strength from the Envoy of Esthar. \"Stay for the night, I insist, rest up and restore your strength, I\"ll get everything ready for your departure tomorrow morning.\" Seifer gave the man a thank you nod. A rest sound like a dream right now, when was the last time he had a decent night of sleep? Too long he believes... The room was draped with heavy silence since the brunette had step in, Seifer\"s brows furrowed into a tight knot and he rub his face with gloveless hand. \"Look, Squally, I\"m tired, pissed off and I am not in the mood to have a starring contest with you.\" Seifer spoke as if toward a five year old child. To him, right now at this particular point of time, Squall Leonhart, the Squall Leonhart who was staring at him with sullen eyes was nothing but a child. \"How \"bout you walk out of my room and back to yours so we could get a decent rest before we need to go in four hours?\" \"...What more have you being keeping to yourself?\" Squall finally spoke when the blond was about to physically removing him from his room. \"...\" Seifer\"s eyes narrowed, making his already narrowed eyes into mere slits. Squall didn\"t ignore the fact that in the dim light, those green eyes had an eerie shone to them. It was one of the many changes Seifer bear after he disappeared before the SeeD exam and appear out of no where to help them at Timber. What more could he be hiding? What else was going to pop up and show him just how much he didn\"t know about the only one in his life that had always been there? \"I have no idea what you mean? Keeping what?\" Squall tightened his hand into a fist making the leather protest at his harsh treatments. \"Don\"t lie. I know you enough to know you\"re hiding something.\" The younger boy growled angrily at how the blond was side stepping his questions. Seifer throw his head back and let out a harsh barked laugh. \"Squally, Squally-boy, you really have no idea what\"s going on... everything in this whole damn world is a lie...get use to it, for the whole lot of us have no where to go other than being in the center of this deception...\" Seifer half drag half carried the brunette until he\"s out of the door. \"Good night, Leonhart, may the \"Lion\" be with you.\" May Griever find you and keep you...May the Dark Lion choose to help you instead of \"her\"... OH...how much more could have gone wrong now? Squall blinked in confusion at the door that had close shut at his face...the parting smirk the blond gave him up settling him more than his words... What in the world is going on now? He felt as if he had never really known his rival at all the years they were together... Or have he ever know the real Seifer Almasy at all? Squall frown as he stomp back toward the room that was assign to him. Those dreams he had...why did it unsettle him like this? ...He did not dream the Seifer before him was not the same one that he grew up with- \"...Do I have parents?\" The pale hair teen asked for the first time in years as he laid on the cold rocky ground miles away from the soldiers\" camp as the last and strongest troop deploy from Shinra in it\"s war against wutai. The only man who could answer him was silent not because he did not know the answer but he could not and would not tell the teen who could have been his son all the pain he had suffer through till now was by the hand of the man that had sire him. Nor could he tell the boy his own mother had abandon him to this fate without even looking back when she step through the door of the manor in that back water town two days after he was born. Sephiroth closed his eyes as he felt the older blond sat next to him, leather gloved hand running through his pale silvery hair in a calming manner, like every time he was resting after Hojo was done with him. Seifer would not tell him. \"Did you know what was going to happen before all this?\" Quistis asked the only one in the whole group that was unaffected by the Sorceress\" attack. The teen- no, the man merely arched an eyebrow and slung the brunette\"s frame over his shoulder. Not caring that all the other was wounded either slightly or seriously. The worst out of them was Rinoa, who had been hit by icicles through her shoulder and stomach. Thinking back Quistis could see all the things Seifer told her to do could have prevented the failed mission but how she was to know? She\"s the Instructor, the only experienced SeeD out of the group and Seifer didn\"t even pass the Exam! He\"s just a Cadet! Why would she listen to him at all!? But she suppressed the tiny hint of regret into the back of her mind. No, right now it\"s more important to find out what else is Seifer hiding from them. \"Trepe, I told you to listen to me but did you?\" Seifer sneered, he look pass the woman and nodded at Irvine who had rush from his hiding spot to join them. \"We\"re getting out of here I\"m not fighting anyone with Leonhart down for the count and with a bunch of brats on the field.\" \"What about Rinoa?\" Quistis asked. \"What about Rinoa?\" Seifer said in a tight voice. He really didn\"t need this right now. \"She need medical attention-\" Seifer snapped, teeth bared like a piss off tiger that\"s about to pounce- \"I do not care about the ones who had foolishly endanger other around them- I told her to leave, go back to her father where she will be the pampered princess she had been acting like. Instead she forced her way to go with us when we\"re risking our lives to complete this damnable mission for the sake of what? This is no fairy tale, the moment she thought she could play us like fools...she should think before she did what she did. If she doesn\"t make it, too bad so sad, I\"m not wasting any energy and resources on non combatant that shouldn\"t even be here in the first place.\" Seifer sneered. \"We\"re mercenary, live weapons the Garden mode us to be. If you want to play house with Rinoa go ahead, just spare me the energy of running Hyperion through both of you.\" Cruel cutting words made Quistis\" face loose what ever color there was. Seifer\"s serious, he wasn\"t buffing. Not with such look in his eyes. \"Do I make myself clear?\" Quistis could only stare wide eyed at the man that made her felt like her first years as a Garden Cadet. \"Ye...yes...\" What had happen to Seifer? This was not the Seifer Almasy she had in her class! Quistis watch the other lead their group waving in and out of the maze like alleyway- How in the world did they come to this?", "mattress; she sank into it finding the pendant on her skin. She wrapped her hand around it and calmed. She felt the gem warm in her hand, she closed her eyes the dim light fading from her mind. She felt silence and peace. Van flew at top speed to the front of the battle. He kareened the flying dragon Escaflowne around, his sword drawn as the mouth of the giant beast opened and ignited flames onto the ground below. He flew up as he encountered a number of blue and green guymelefs. He evaded their weapons as barbs launched at him. A purple guymelf de cloaked in the air a hundred meters away. Van was caught off gaurd. His heart raced as he and the Escaflowne shot backward. The Dragon began top descend, Van holding on; his biceps and forearms buckling to keep him from being thrown to his death. The Dragon at last regained equilibrium and righted itself in the air. Van pulled hard on the reigns. He could take the battle to the ground , but he had an advantag from the air. If he could only avoid that purple guymelf....it had disappeared again. His dark amber eyes burning against the rising heat he searched the sky. Still nothing. The enemy had vanished. That is it vanished long enough to catch him square in the chest with a silver bolt. Van felt his breath catch in his chest, he struggled; panic filled him as he fell from Escaflowne. As he fell he called out. He hit the tree line within minutes and his familial white wings expanded from his body to slow his fall. He hit the ground not shortly after, and lost concsiousness. Darkness clouded his mind; and night settled over him. In the darkness of sleep Hitomi saw her grandmother\"s pendant, swinging. The gem had enlarged to be a pendulum larger than herself; it began to swing like a grandfather clock. She counted it, her pulse quickened, and her mouth grew dry. She felt the emptiness of her life pouring in on her like a flood of water; washing over her coldly; but she still saw the pendulum swing, faster and faster. The walls of her mind began to disolve and she felt sheer madness and pain over take her. She fell to her knees, her heart aching as though it were rent in two. She cried out in pain her hands slamming onto the cold dark ground. She felt wind rush over her, and she smelled smoke from a distant fire. Her senses flared, and she became aware of the world around her. She looked up at the sky through a dark tree line; and saw the most bizzare and ammazing sight; the Moon, and the Earth hanging beside it on the horizon. She stumbled to her feet, shaky legs standing and wobbling like the deck of a ship. She fell back to the ground crawling and dissoriented. Hitomi felt the moisture of the earth, and smelled mold. She wanted to vomit...but wait it wasn\"t just the smell of mold, it was something else. As a doctor she recognized it immidiately. Blood! Over coming her incompetent balance the brunette stumble forward until she stumbled over something large. She sank down feeling around in the dim light; it was a body. The body was injured. She heard a deep moan of pain; it was a man! She didn\"t know who it was, or where she was, but she took an oath to save lives; and she wasn\"t going to give up now. Author\"s note: Hope you guys like it. It was a random story idea I had, and hopefully I\"ll continue to update it often. Please R&R. ^_^ Author\"s note: Just in case anyone wants to know; I am currently operating with out spell check or grammar check..so sorry for anyone who is OCD. Any ways with out further adeau; chapter two. \"Oh God are you alright?\" Hitomi asked in a whispered panic. She felt the man\"s neck for a pulse; it was weak. She gulped. Generally the first thing she would do is get a gurney and relocate her patient to an OR stat, but looking around she wasn\"t sure their was a hospital for miles...or in existance. She breathed in and out a cole of times. She would have to make do with what she had. She felt for the pockets on her white lab coat...and realized all too conviniently she was only wearing her bathrobe. She forced thoughts of embarassment away. This man was dying. For the moment however, he still had some pulse, and he was breathing. She began with a quick examination of his limbs; arms, legs, hands...as she reached his hsoulders she noticed the strangest protrusion. Beneath the scapula the muscle extended outward in a wing like fashion. She froze, taking a moment to analyze this new discovery. A bird man? Was their such a thing? It was irrelevant. Her initial evaluation; the patient had severe brusing on his torso, two cracked ribs, a fractured radius and most likely a concussion. The blood smell came from a number of superficial abrassions; most likely sustained during a fall. That brought her back to the bird man theory. She felt behind the scapula following the muscle and the arch of the wing. She realized the wing was larger than it looked and she began to open it to check for vital injuries. So far so good. She extended the wing and had to stand in doing so. Carefrully Hitomi brushed an area that felt pulp like; the man yelled in pain, he must have awakened. Then he fell silent. \"I\"m sorry, I just needed to know if you had sustained an injury, I didn\"t mean to...\" She trailed off. It didn\"t matter, the man had regained his strength enough to pull her feet out from under her and barrel down on top of her. She hit the ground hard. Her back suddenly ached from the fall, and her head began to throb. The sudden shock was then replaced by the weight of a heavy grime covered body. She froze. Her emerald eyes searching in the moonlight. The man had removed a blade of some sort and it pressed against her throat. The length of it gleamed. She felt her body grow cold, but she was surprised at the brief flash of embarassment again. Oh God I;m not wearing any clothes! Oh please don\"t notice. At first Hitomi wasn\"t sure what to do, but she was aware of the man\"s infirmities. Taking a brave shot she chose diplomacy, but if it failed then the palm of her hand would meet his cracked ribs. \"Who are you?\" He growled, his voice slow and deep. She tried her voice, but it came out nervous and scared. Damn! \"My name is Doctor Hitomi Kanzaki. Please I didn\"t mean to....\" He cut her off. \"I don;\"t believe you, you\"re working for the Emperor aren\"t you?\" He implied, she felt the cold steel press harder on her flesh. \"Answer me!\" He demanded. Hitomi was very scared. \"I\"m not lying, you need medical assistance.\" She insisted. She bit her lip. \"Please you\"re very injured, I can help you.\" He moved closer to her face straddling her legs. She felt a flush of heat. His face mived to within inches of her own. Please believe me, I don\"t want to have to use force on you.\" He almost laughed, but she knew he was looking into her eyes; he would see the scincerity. The knife pulled back, but she was still scared. When the blade disappeared she found hands on either side of her head....what was he looking at. Then he pressed his body low against hers and whispered in her ear. \"I believe you Hitomi; just don\"t move and don\"t make a sound. We\"re being watched.\" Hitomi filled with panic, her heart racing. She could hear the man\"s chest on top of her, his heart beat was steady, almost calm. Barely willing to breath they waited. Hitomi was not sure what kind of predator it might be, but she was willing to trust this wild man. After what felt like an hour he spoke. \"Alright, I think it\"s clear.\" She flet his heat retreat from her, and one strong hand pulled her to her feet. Her hands immidiately went to the opening of her robe to hold it shut. He didn\"t seem to notice, and if he did he didn\"t say anything or seem to care much. She put aside her discomfort for a moment and returned to the problem at hand. \"Is their a clean source of water nearby?\" She asked. \"We should dress and set all of your wounds soon, or else you could have some permenent limitations.\" She insisted. She found a pair of dark amber eyes looking at her curiously. \"You are persistent; but please lady my name is Van. I think before you and I travel anywhere together, this simple exchange is required.\" She agreed. \"As per you request I think I can find a stream, I flew over one not more than an hour that way.\" He said motioning in a direction east. Hitomi nodded absently, her mind going back to the abnormality. \"Then you are indeed a bird-man?\" She asked. Their was a hesitation at first. Then he answered. \"No, I flew over this area on a machine....\" Van then realized he was unaware of the Escaflowne\"s location. \"In any case we should get moving.\" Hitomi heard him moving toward the east, and she followed the rustle of his movement into the foliage. They traveled for a long time in silence, and with her bare feet, Hitomi soon asked to pause. Un-use to the terrain and barely clothed she wasn\"t sure how long she could proceed. \"So how did you know I was telling the truth earlier?\" She asked, curious. Van had stoped and leaned up against a tree. She could make out his sillohette. It looked as though the one injured wing remained; as for the other, she was unsure. He raised his head to look at her, undoubtably weary himself. \"Honestly; it was your smell.\" He said. She blushed, and was greatful for the darkness. \"You smell unbelievably odd. Like the well to do women of the royal courts; but you have not the attire nor the personality to be such.\" He added. She chose to take this as a compliment. \"Wow, I didn\"t know my smell was so peculiar.\" She smiled, though he probably did not see it. \"And no one that I know ever seemed to notice.\" He wiped his forehead. He was straining, she could tell. \"Well when you spend nearly a half hour on top f somebody else, you tend to notice these things...\" he trailed off. \"And other things.\" He was trying to politely tell her, he was aware of her near nakedness. The reminder made her more than happy to continue on their route, even if just to be distracted from conversation. \"We should probably get going again no?\" She insisted. He nodded and took up the front. One thought popped in to her mind as she followed him. \"What were we hiding from back their?\" His voice was hushed. \"An assasin. I decided that you had to be telling the truth, because assasins don\"t generally mark their own men as targets.\" She felt cold all over. Did he just save her life? \"I noticed the intruder a little after you arrived, but it left as quietly as it came.\" She nodded. She moved closer behind him, if just to feel safe. They reached a small stream fifteen minutes later. The smell of fresh water was welcome to the earthlings nostrils. And she rushed to it and splashed the contents of the bank onto her face. She loved the water. The cool sensation revived her, and she sat back on her heels. It was then that she noticed Van had collapsed onto the ground. His eyes looked glazed, but he remained conscious. \"Don\"t move; I need to get you undressed if I\"m going to wrap your ribs.\" She began to remove a layer of light metal armor and leather. Beneath the leather flying jacket was a soft light tunic. The shirt was moist; and she knew she probably wouldn\"t be able to get it over his head, not with a bad wing anyways. The lame man produced his knife again and she knew he was suggesting she cut the shirt off. She nodded and expertly handled the blade opening the shirt like she would a patient\"s flesh during an operation. Delicately she removed the peices and tore them into strips, tied them together into one long bandage. \"Do you mind if I wash you first?\" She asked. As it was the environment was far from sterile, but he made no movement to protest. She tore the sleeves off of her robe and dunked one in the water. She sponged his torso removing blood from scrapes, and debris from his bruises. Hitomi began her wrap around the shoulder with out a wing and then across his pectorals. Soon enough the makeshift bandage was secured with a stealthy knot. Satisfied she sat back for a moment. Her next task was to reset the stranger\"s arm. Van remained still though she knew it could feel good. She had very little fabric left, and feared the bottom of her robe would have to serve as such. Luckily she only needed enough to make a sling, and found her expensive bathing robe was now a short sleeveless frock. \"Maybe you should get some sleep.\" She suggested. Van hesitated. \"Don\"t worry, I have no wish to run off. Besides I couldn\"t get very far, and I don\"t exactly know anyone but you.\" He cracked a smile. A gust picked up and rushed through her, she shivered. \"I might get cold.\" He said weakly. Even though she had securely replaced his leather jacket he said it. Hitomi had a feeling that the sentiment was intended for her. She concidered the choices and conceded. Her pride would have to take a back seat, beside if her patient said he would be cold, then dammit she needed to keep him warm. It didn\"t hurt either that she had finally gotten a good look at him. The moon and the earth had risen over their clearing and she found her saviour Van was tall dark and handsome. \"We should move into the trees though.\" He said. She nodded. She picked up the remaining scraps of fabric and put them in her exterior pockets. Helping Van settle under a large tree she sat down beside him, leaning into his side, trying not to agravate his ribs. \"Don\"t worry, I\"ll be fine by morning.\" He said, and that was the last thing she heard. Moments later she was asleep. She didn\"t dream of giant pendulums, and she didn\"t dream of home, or the strange place to which she had come; all she found was rest; warm, dark and silent. Hitomi stirred sluggishly, she had been awakened by the cold. Her legs were bare and she had fallen over onto her side. \"Good morning.\" She heard and oddly familiar voice say. Hitomi sat up and found a heavy leather jacket had been placed over her. She rubbed her eyes and ran her fingers through her short brown hair. \"Morning?\" She asked. Morning for her was normally a pager beep, or an emergency phone call followed by ten cups of coffee. She looked around and caught sight of the earth in the sky and everything came rushing back to her. She shook from head to toe and Van took notice. \"You can put that jacket on if you\"re cold.\" He said. She could hardly believe it, he was unphased by the temperature and aside from his trousers he only had bandages on. She nodded and pulled the jacket around her, slipping her arms into the sleeves. \"Thank you.\" She said. She brushed a peice of hair from her face and walked over to join him by the stream. \"I\"m sorry, I\"m not really a morning person.\" She said softly. He smiled, and she noticed for the first time that he had a very heart felt smile. She additionally noticed that as she peered at his back, that his injured wing had vanished. \"How?\" She inquired, not wanting to be rude, but he noticed her gaze. \"Oh, yes. My wings retreat normally, but apparently when they are injured they do not.\" He said as though finding out the hard way for the first time. She nodded still stunned. \"I\"m sorry.\" She replied bowing. \"I didn\"t mean to be nosy like that.\" She said and shook her head. He waved it off. \"It\"s alright, I\"m sure it makes you a good healer where you come from.\" He said. She flushed. \"Where might taht be?\" He asked. He sat down on a large rock, he had some how managed a small fire and two fish were cooking on sticks near the little flames. She felt her mouth water, but remembered her manners. \"I\"m from Japan....\" She realized that really meant nothing to him. Instead she turned to the blue moon hanging in the sky. \"There, that\"s where I come from.\" She said. His dark eyes stared off at the blue moon for a good long minute and then he nodded. \"I see, although I\"d have guessed as much.\" He said. He offered her a seat by the fire. She was about ready to accept it when she felt the urge to answer nature\"s call. \"Can you hold that thought for a minute?\" She trotted off deeper into the trees to relieve herself. She found a good spot near a bush of trees. This was like camping she thought. When she was finished she set her robe back down and fluffed her hair, then she felt a terrible itch on her rear. \"Please don\"t be poison oak.\" She begged. She lifted the side of her pink satin frock and noticed a perfectly round bug bite. \"You have got to be kidding me.\" It was the size of a quarter; and it itched like nobody\"s buisness. She tried to ignore it. \"Food first Hitomi.\" She reminded herself. She smoothed the front of her robe, when she heard a high male voice. \"Food? You have food, that\"s wondrful; I\"d be more than willing to trade for...\" Hitomi couldn\"t help it she let out a horrifically feminine scream as a short round man appeared, with protruding teeth. In seconds Van\"s form appeared in front of her. \"Mole man.\" Van said in a threatening voice. The mole man drew back a bit. \"Van Fanel!\" He didn\"t seemed terribly scared, but the two were obviously aqcuainted. \"I\"m sorry, I didn\"tknow this woman was traveling with you.\" He had a nervous laugh. Van gave a barely noticable nod. \"Well then, I was going to offer it to your friend; but how abut a trade?\" Van lowered his gaurd. \"What do you want? He asked skeptically. \"A meal, and some good company.\" He waved lightly at Hitomi. She could feel Van pressing back against her supportively. \"I am more than willing to share my food with another traveler, but this girl is not for sale.\" Then it hit HItomi. Where the HELL am I?! She gulped, she wouldn\"t have dreamed she could be on the menu. The mole man seemed a little disappointed, but he conceeded. \"Well I\"ll take what I can get.\" He said. Van rolled his eyes. They waited as the mole man walked past them toward the stream and the cooking fish. \"So where are you off to your ma...\" Van cut him a quick look, and he was silent. \"I\"m headed back to my camp. I\"d say where, but who knows who you\"re working for these days.\" He insinuated. The mole man nodded. \"True, I\"m not all that picky; although their is one man I\"ll never do buisness with again. Nearly took my head, and that was AFTER I brought him what he wanted.\" He had expressive facial gestures, and he mainly gave them toward Hitomi. She sat quietly watching. Her hand went quickl;y to the necklace around her neck. She held the gem tightly while the mole man talked. \"You know what, I have something that might be helpful after all...\" THe mole man \"s eyes perked up and moved to the mole man\"s pack. He pulled out a smal bundle of leather. He carefully peeled back the sides to reveal a smelly green paste. \"What is that?\" Hitomi asked amazed and disgusted at the same time. \"It\"s a salve, you know for that bite on your...\" He paused as her face colored scarlett. The brunette jumped to her feet. \"You were watching me? you digusting little...\" She was furious and embarassed beyond belief. She couldn\"t believe how she felt. She found Van putting his hands on her shoulders. \"Why I should...\" She was interupted. \"Why are you so upset, I\"m trying to make up for my misdeed. After all that bite has got to be bothering you.\" She seethed. In truth it itched immensely. She ground her teeth. Van let go of her and walked forward, he was surprisingly agile even with cracked ribs and a sling. \"Alright, you heard the lady. She doesn\"t want what you\"ve got. You shuld probably get on your way.\" He suggested wisely. Hitomi wondered if she should calm down and accept the appology. She really could use an anti-itch cream. She lowered her shoulders submissively. \"Wait.\" She said breathing out. \"I will accept your appology, and your salve; but no more spying on me, or peeking or anything.\" She said a little exhasperated. He nodded his bald head fervently. \"Of course, of course.\" He waddled forward and handed the leather full of salve to her. She accepted it. \"May I just say that you have the loveliest...\" He broke off as her horrified expression turned dangerous. \"Never mind, forget I said anything.\" Author\"s note: Hey everybody, had to throw just a little bit of humor in their, hah hah. Okay well hope you liked it. Sorry if the mole man is a little occ; although I always thought that he was a little pervy. Author\"s note: Thanks to everyone who reveiwed! I thought before I begin the next chapter I should start with giving thakns and answering a quick question. Hitomi is roughly around twenty six/ maybe twenty seven. Van is a year older than her or so. And they lead their lives in the same manner as before, except the war with Zaibach did not start until much later, and Van\"s father did not die until recently either; which means Falkon did not become evil until later. The trio travelled silently for a long time. After two days they encountered a vilage where clothing could be purchased for Hitomi, and to her relief thick blankets. The sleeping arrangements had been awkward. Van had become suddenly distant in the Mole man\"s presence. He slept by himself and she slept near the fire; the mole man had to sleep on the far side from the same Hitomi felt she was getting any sleep because she worried the Mole man would some how get past her chivalrous protector. They stood just outside of a tavern. After purchasing clothes Hitomi had found the room in the back and was able to change. She returned dressed in a long green skirt and pale blue shirt with a brown vest. Van found a good shoemaker and"]}

He tried that. Not at first, of course. For the first few weeks, he held onto a delusion that maybe she\"d change her mind. Maybe he\"d hear a knock on the door and find her standing outside apartment 3B with a tear-stained face, the same desperation embedded in her hazel eyes that he had seen in his own. It couldn\"t be that easy for her, could it? The pizza guy knocked. His neighbor, Mrs. Rosenthal knocked. Even Hardy knocked. Each time his heart would plummet into his stomach, a mixture of hope and fear of disappointment. Disappointment always won, and Aria was never behind the door. It couldn\"t be forever, could it? The break-up couldn\"t be real, could it? A short time ago, the only real thing in his life was what he had with Aria. Now the only real thing in his life was the very empty drawer in his dresser, not filled with Aria\"s things that smelled like her. Hope was meant to be a good thing, but he quickly realized it was his greatest enemy. The reason he continued to wake up, but also the reason he didn\"t want to. Sometimes he wanted to give up. But by giving up, he\"d surrender in his fight to hold her in his arms again. He was in a tug-o-war; one side was his own happiness, the other was Aria\"s. A painful sting tore through his heart when he finally came to the realization that Aria wasn\"t happy when she was with him, and he couldn\"t hold her down like that. He just couldn\"t. He thought that would be the most painful part of letting her go-until he realized she could be happy with someone else. Someone who wasn\"t him. He remembered spotting her across the street, sitting at a table in front of the ice cream shop alone. He felt sorry for her. Who would lick the sides of her ice cream cone so it wouldn\"t drip onto her fingers? He always did that. Who would eat the last bite of her cone? He always did that. A tall, blonde-haired man opened the door and sat down across from Aria, eliciting a smile on her face that he hadn\"t seen in ages. He handed her a cone filled with her favorite ice cream. Only Ezra was supposed to know her favorite ice cream. It hadn\"t even taken her a month to move on and forget everything they had, everything they fought for. Their relationship was dead as if it had never been alive. So, he tried to follow her lead, and as soon as he stumbled into his apartment that afternoon, he opened his laptop with a heavy sigh. He went to his bookmarks, his cursor hovering over a page he hadn\"t visited since he and Aria broke up-Bisson-Morar Jewelers. And like ripping off a band-aid, he deleted his plans to propose to his girlfriend, with an engagement ring whose expensive diamonds didn\"t even come close to Aria\"s priceless beauty. Forget Aria? He tried that. But it didn\"t work. Which is precisely why his best friend Hardy was dragging Ezra through the costume shop in the center of Rosewood, trying to convince him that it was okay to leave his apartment and do something besides organize and reorganize the fuzzy lime in his fridge. Even Ezra knew it was time to move on. It was time to find someone else\"s gelato to lick. He followed Hardy through the aisle of men\"s costumes as if he were a small child following his mother through the grocery store. Not paying attention, solely there because he had to be. Super heroes. Cavemen. Vampires. Ugly masks. All the typical costumes lined the aisle. Hardy stopped abruptly and turned to look at Ezra, impatience written across his face. \"Are you even looking?\" \"I told you I don\"t really want to go to a costume party,\" he reiterated for the tenth time that day. \"It\"s not really my scene. Even Aria didn\"t make me go to these things.\" Hardy sighed and shook his head, then placed his hands on Ezra\"s shoulders and looked him straight in the eyes. \"Ezra. There will be women at this party,\" he reminded him. \"Women in tiny costumes. Women who will go back with you to your apartment and make you forget you ever thought a 17-year-old was good enough.\" Of course Aria was good enough. Ezra brushed Hardy\"s hands off his shoulders. \"Fine, I\"ll go, but I\"m not bringing anyone back to my place.\" He stepped aside and walked passed Hardy towards the exit of the costume shop. \"That\"s all I can ask for, Ezra, that\"s all I can ask for,\" he called after him, following quickly behind him. \"You didn\"t get a costume!\" \"Don\"t need one,\" Ezra replied. Although it was the beginning of December, the sidewalk in front of Hollis Bar & Grill was packed with costume-wearing party-goers waiting to get inside one of Rosewood\"s most anticipated events of the year. It wasn\"t the childlike innocence that screamed through the air on Halloween; it was an annual 21+ costume party \"charity event\" infamous for drunken hookups between vampires and sexy nurses. It was also the bar where Ezra met Aria two Augusts before. Hardy pushed Ezra through the crowd of college students and 20somethings gathered in front of the entrance, using him as a human bulldozer. Ezra wore a black suit, one he often wore to teach, and a plain white Phantom of the Opera mask that only covered the right side of his face. It was the simplest costume he could manage, as well as one of his favorite characters. Behind him, Hardy was dressed as Jack Sparrow, reasoning that \"women loved pirates.\" Ezra thought women preferred vampires, but he didn\"t really care whether Hardy scored tonight. They stopped at the door and when Ezra didn\"t budge, Hardy let out an irritated sigh and moved in front of him, raising an eyebrow. \"Forget how to open a door?\" He pushed it open and stepped in, making sure Ezra followed. The bar had transformed into an extravagant costume party, illuminated by only black lights and the occasional woman covered in sparkles. Loud music overwhelmed the small space full of people who would likely be intoxicated in a matter of hours. Or maybe minutes. Ezra ran his hand through his hair and squinted at the dark room. \"I\"m a little rusty when it comes to picking up women.\" \"Maybe that\"s because you\"re not used to hitting on girls outside of a classroom,\" Hardy pointed out with a slight chuckle, patting Ezra playfully on the back. \"I didn\"t meet her in-\" \"I know, I know, you met her in a \"bar\" supposedly,\" Hardy interrupted, but from the skepticism in his voice, it was clear he never believed Ezra\"s claim. \"Just talk to the first girl you bump into and you\"ll forget Aria before you know it.\" He spoke as if it were the most simple task, as if one look at another woman would make Ezra forget 450 days with Aria. \"And I\"ve already found my soulmate in the mermaid costume near the ladies\" room. Good luck, man,\" Hardy said as he walked off, leaving Ezra by himself in a place he didn\"t belong. Ezra sighed and stood awkwardly in the center of the room while dozens of people brushed by his body on their way to the bar. Where should he start? He rested his hand on the back of his neck and scratched, frozen in a state of apprehension. He wasn\"t really a dancer, so that was out of the question. Maybe it would be wise to drink away his anxiety and let the alcohol take over in his quest to find a woman. With a deep breath, he lifted his feet and followed the throngs of people to the bar until he bumped into a petite woman walking in the opposite direction. \"Chase?\" she asked, squinting her eyes, trying to make out Ezra\"s face in the dim light. Her eyes went wide and she took a step back. \"E-ezra?\" Ezra stood speechless as he found Aria standing in front of him. She was dressed in a vintage floor-length ivory lace gown with a corset and sleeves that hung off her shoulders, showing off her flawless skin. Her dark chestnut hair fell in beautiful curls halfway down her back. It never occurred to him that she would possibly attend an adult party, but then he remembered her fake ID that he never approved of. A few silent moments passed before Aria added, \"It\"s good to see you.\" He smiled. \"You look great,\" he replied with a nervous lick of his lips. \"Are you Christine?\" She nodded. \"From the Phantom of the Opera,\" she answered with a small smile while her eyes searched the room. \"I better get going. My boyfr,\" she hesitated, \"Chase is waiting for me.\" A painful stab pierced through Ezra\"s stomach. He nodded and watched her walk off in search of her boyfriend, wanting so badly to pick up the delicate ivory lace floating across the dirty bar floor. He continued to stare until she found the same man he had seen outside the ice cream shop. She greeted him with a quick peck on the lips. \"I\"m waiting for you too,\" Ezra mumbled. Chase was dressed quite obviously as an angel, a cheesy white halo atop his blonde curls. Aria shook her head and gave her boyfriend a faux smile that only Ezra recognized as disappointment. He couldn\"t quite make out the words that came from their lips, but he smiled to himself as he realized mixup. Chase was supposed to dress as the Angel of Music, also known as the Phantom of the Opera. Aria turned her head and caught Ezra staring at her, causing him to blush and dart his eyes towards the ground-and completely missing the bright small that she gave him. Ezra felt a hand on his shoulder as he stared at the ground. \"Okay, maybe the second girl you bump into,\" Hardy told him. Ezra turned to find Hardy standing behind him. \"You saw?\" Hardy nodded and handed Ezra a beer. \"Don\"t worry. Turns out my mermaid already has a merman.\" He took a sip of his beer and swallowed. \"Round two?\" Ezra took a large gulp from his bottle and nodded. \"Round two, indeed.\" The party wasn\"t supposed to end until the early hours of the morning, but Ezra left shortly after Hardy lassoed a cowgirl with minimal clothing to take home. It\"s not that he didn\"t attempt round two. Or three. Or four. But every time he found the courage to talk to a woman, his eyes would attach themselves to Aria like a magnet. Dancing with Chase. Laughing with Chase. Kissing Chase. Ezra quickly caught on that watching another girl didn\"t exactly impress women. Thus, he was defeated every round. His bed was far more comfortable and lacked the overwhelming awkwardness that the party boasted, anyway. He lay on his side and tugged his blanket over his body and fell asleep within minutes; the party was exhausting both emotionally and physically. He hadn\"t been asleep for more than an hour when his phone emitted a shrill ring from his nightstand a few feet away. He groaned and felt for his phone in the darkness, knocking over a tissue box and a bottle of water in the process. He grabbed his phone and brought it to his eyes, squinting from the harsh light of the iPhone\"s screen. Aria He blinked several times to see if he was imagining her name on the front of his screen. He hadn\"t seen her name on his phone in two months, when she had called to find a place to break up with him. He took a deep breath and cleared his throat, attempting to wake himself up and diminish the grogginess in his voice before he answered. \"Hello?\" The line was quiet for a few seconds until he heard quiet, muffled sobs. \"Aria?\" The sobs became louder and she tried to speak, but it came out as a string of nonsensical syllables mixed with her tears. \"Are you okay?\" She audibly took a deep breath before she attempted to speak again. \"I made a terrible mistake and I need you,\" she wept. It was clear that the simple sentence required a great amount of strength for her to muster over the phone, as if it were breaking her pride. \"Text me where you are and I\"ll be there as fast as I can.\" \"Thank you,\" she whispered, and the phone call ended. Ezra jumped out of bed and grabbed his jacket, not even stopping to change out of his pajamas. His phone vibrated in his hand with Aria\"s location. And that\"s when he noticed it was nearly 3 a.m. It was thirty minutes before Ezra pulled up alongside the curb in front of an apartment complex in Brookhaven. He found Aria perched on the cement steps, holding her legs against her chest and trembling in the cold winter air. When she spotted the small silver car approaching, she stood and slowly walked towards him. He leaned over the center console and pushed open the passenger side door. Aria silently got in the car and buckled her seatbelt, not turning to say a word to Ezra. She only wore a thin, ivory silk knee-length slip that must\"ve been underneath the white gown from the costume party. Her hair was disheveled and smudged black makeup sat under her eyes. Ezra reached in the back seat and grabbed a grey hoodie with the words \"Hollis College\" faded on the front, placing it on her lap. She accepted it and pulled it over her frozen body before leaning her cheek against the window. They drove through dark, barren streets for ten minutes of silence, broken only by the occasional quiet sob coming from the passenger seat. Tears and makeup trickled down Aria\"s cheek, and she used the oversized sleeves of Ezra\"s hoodie to wipe them away. He glanced in her direction every so often; his mind overwhelmed with curiosity while his heart was broken with Aria\"s pain. \"Sorry,\" Aria muttered under her breath. \"This is embarrassing.\" Ezra shook his head and hesitated a few moments before he replied. \"You don\"t have to be embarrassed with me. About anything.\" The creases of Aria\"s mouth turned up ever so slightly to form a weak smile. \"Thank you.\" Ezra knew he couldn\"t drive an additional twenty minutes with Aria crying two feet away, even if it were 3:30 in the morning. He pulled over on a dirt patch on the side of the street and put the car in park, then took his keys out of the ignition and turned his hazard lights on. He exhaled a heavy breath and moved his body to look at Aria. \"Even if we\"re not together, I\"ll always be here for you. Don\"t forget that. I\"m still the same Ezra.\" Silence lingered in the air. Aria wouldn\"t look at him. A car drove by and temporarily filled the car with light, illuminating Aria\"s tears. \"Do you want to talk about it?\" Aria shook her head and looked down, focusing on the nail polish on her fingernails. She didn\"t reply, but she didn\"t request for him to start driving either. He eyed her disheveled appearance and felt his stomach sink as he came to a realization. \"Did he hurt you?\" he asked as delicately as he could. Aria continued to look down at her hands, picking at her nail polish. \"I know what you\"re thinking,\" she mumbled. \"We didn\"t do anything.\" \"I wasn\"t thinking that,\" he replied. Aria bit her lower lip. \"I didn\"t want to do anything,\" she clarified. \"But he did, so he decided to throw a tea kettle at me.\" Ezra\"s eyes widened. \"Are you okay?\" She shook her head and exhaled a deep breath. \"I was scared so I ran out of there as fast as I could and called the first person on speed dial,\" she sighed. \"It was like my relationship was leading to this point, and if it wasn\"t going to happen when he wanted it to, then I wasn\"t worth it to him.\" She moved her gaze to look at Ezra for the first time that night, and he finally saw the desperation embedded in her hazel eyes that he\"d been looking for. He wish he hadn\"t been looking for it. \"Why doesn\"t he care about me? What did I do wrong?\" He shook his head. \"If he doesn\"t love Aria Montgomery, he\"s probably not human.\" A small smile broke through the tears falling down her cheeks. The silence returned to the car as neither of them knew where they stood or where to go, and her attention returned to her fingernails. Aria let out an irritated sigh. \"You don\"t have to be afraid to touch me,\" she told him. \"What?\" \"You can touch me,\" she repeated. \"Do you want me to?\" Aria bit her lip and nodded. \"I could really use a hug right now.\" Ezra leaned over and lightly put his arm around her shoulders, but if Aria\"s continuous tears were any indication, it wasn\"t good enough for her. She reached beside her and unbuckled her seatbelt, then eyed Ezra\"s lap. He replied to her silent request with a nod, then pushed his seat back to allow room for two bodies. She climbed over the center console and sat on his lap with her back against the door and her legs across his lap. He wrapped his arms around her body in a tentative embrace, pulling her close against him. Without his permission, Aria buried her head into his chest, her tiny hands gripping the fabric of his t-shirt. She was finally comfortable enough in his arms to release the tears she held back, sobbing loudly into his chest. Ezra ran his fingers through her hair with one hand, his other hand rubbing her back. \"Don\"t cry. Don\"t cry,\" he soothed. \"I\"m right here and everything is going to be okay.\" She nuzzled her head into the crook of his neck and he brushed his lips lightly against her forehead. He continued to hold her for the following minutes waiting for her tears to run their course. Aria took a deep breath, successfully holding back another wave of tears.\"Before Chase and I started kissing tonight, he went to the bathroom. He had to brush his teeth,\" she began, as if it was a ridiculous concept. \"Remember when we\"d eat Chinese food and just...start going at it on your couch? Not caring about our bad breath or food stuck in our teeth?\" Ezra nodded and smiled at the memory, then wiped his thumb over a stray tear on her cheek. She looked up at him. \"I want that again. If I can\"t make out with someone with chicken stuck in my teeth, I don\"t want anything at all.\" Ezra pressed another kiss against her forehead and chuckled. \"Only if you\"re happy,\" he told her. \"That\"s all that matters to me.\" He held her close and ran his hand up and down her arm, resting his head on top of hers. Aria leaned away from him and shook her head. \"You should hate me. Why don\"t you hate me?\" \"I couldn\"t hate you.\" It was a promise he knew he could keep. \"But I left you and dated someone else.\" Ezra turned Aria\"s body so she was facing him. \"I\"m glad you did. Now I know we\"re real. This is it. We are it.\" She lowered her eyebrows and stared at him with a look of confusion. \"What do you mean?\" He took a deep breath and released Aria for a moment to nervously run his fingers through his dark curls. He didn\"t know what he was doing, but he couldn\"t stop himself from doing it. \"I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to marry you.\" Aria blinked her eyes several times before cupping his face in her hands, her thumbs grazing over the stubble along his jawline. \"So marry me.\" Their lips were inches apart, their breath fanning each other\"s face. \"Okay,\" was all he said before pressing his lips against hers and kissing her deeply for the first time in months. His teeth lingered on her bottom lip before they pulled apart. \"Good answer,\" she told him, her hands still cupping his face. She smiled a bright smile that warmed his heart. \"Are we engaged now?\" Ezra chuckled and leaned his forehead against hers and brushed his lips against her nose. \"Can I buy you a ring first?\" \"I guess that would be okay.\" Ezra pulled her back against his body and embraced her petite body as tight as he could, as if she could escape at any moment. Another car passed theirs, it\"s headlights illuminating their faces for a split second. Even with makeup and tears staining her face, Ezra couldn\"t believe how lucky he was to have her-possibly forever. How Chase didn\"t see this could\"ve been one of the greatest mysteries of the world. \"Can we stay here for for a few more minutes?\" she asked. Ezra looked at the clock on the radio reading 3:55 and nodded. \"Let\"s just live out here, okay?\" Aria shook her head, her hair brushing against the crook of his neck where it rested. \"I miss your apartment.\" She moved her eyes away from his and blushed. \"I miss the sacred ground,\" she whispered. \"It hasn\"t felt like home without you.\" He looked at her sheepishly, a shade of red appearing on his cheeks to match Aria\"s. She looked up into his eyes. \"Nothing feels like home without you.\" Her arm moved behind his neck, her fingers running circles on the nape of his neck just under his t-shirt. \"Nobody is like you. I didn\"t realize that until someone threw a tea kettle at me.\" \"Well, I have to ask you a very important question, then,\" Ezra announced, smiling into her hazel eyes. \"Yes?\" \"Did you do your homework, Miss Montgomery?\" Aria\"s eyes widened before she giggled and decided to play along. \"No, I did not, Mr. Fitz. But maybe I could get some extra credit?\" \"You\"re such a bad student.\" Ezra sighed loudly and rolled his eyes. \"I think I might have some extra credit waiting in the back of the car, if you\"re willing to do it.\" Aria smiled and kissed him softly on the lips. \"Yeah, I think I am.\" And that\"s when Ezra realized Hardy was right for possibly the first time in their friendship. Maybe he would be taking home the first girl he bumped into, after all. Becca was a big help creating this, because it was basically a result of our constant creation of Ezria scenes. Thank you for letting me write this. I love you! PLEASE REVIEW. Follow me on twitter, sleepnthehrding!", "\"That was close,\" muttered Anime Sonic. \"Alright, I\"m cured!\" stated Evil Sonic in glee, checking his body over. The troop finally snapped out of their shock and ran towards the Sonics, joy written all over their faces. ...Until twin beams of yellow light smote the ground just in front of them, sending them flying. \"What was that!\" bellowed SatAM Sonic in surprise as he watched Sally, Tails and the others pick themselves off the ground. \"Bwa ha ha ha ha ha! Why don\"t you look up and see, losers?\" Eyes widening in recognition, nearly everybody in the vicinity slowly turned their gaze sky and gasped in shocked horror. Fleetway Sonic was floating above them yet his appearance was drastically altered. His sapphire fur was now glowing an intense yellow colour and some of his spikes pointed upward. The green pupils of his eyes had been replaced with red swirls spiraling into the white depths. His mouth was drawn up in a spiteful grin and the tips of sharp teeth could be seen sticking out of his mouth. \"Hey, how did you turn into Super Sonic without any Chaos Emeralds?\" queried Sonic X with a mixture of awe and astonishment. \"\"Chaos Emeralds?' Since when did I need Chaos Emeralds to become superior to everyone around me? All I need is an adequate dosage of Chaos Energy or a bit of stress and, poof, here I am, ready to end your miserable lives!\" He flew down to their level and sucker-punched Evil Sonic, sending him reeling into and collapsing onto the other Sonics. \"Hey! What are you doing?\" demanded SU Sonic as he pushed Evil Sonic\"s foot out of his mouth. \"What does it look like I\"m doing, dimwit?\" Fleetway Super Sonic now levitated a foot off the ground. \"There can only be one of me, even if the other \"me\"s are just weaklings in comparison. So I\"ll fix that problem right now by simply killing you all!\" With that said, he charged. Authoress\" Note: You guys are in for a humongous treat this chapter...and Fleetway Super Sonic\"s only a part of it! Yeehaw! And on a more sombre note... I think need help in getting back on track with my writing. I wanna be able to publish at least once every two weeks again instead of every month. Any suggestions...please? Chapter 15: Melee Slamming the door of the fortress behind him, Evil Sonic leaned against it, both from panting too hard and in a futile attempt to keep the thing that was chasing him out. Robo-Robotnik looked up from where he had been going over some blueprints in irritation. \"What is it?\" \"(pant, pant) ...Th-thing! Yellow! Red eyes! Psychotic! Help!\" Due to his shortness of breath and fear, the malicious hedgehog could only form fragments of sentences. The foreign mad scientist\"s eyebrow furrowed. What could possibly scare him so much that he\"d say the one four-letter, \"h\"-word his pride would never allow him to utter? Kablam! As if to answer his unspoken question (and, knowing this universe, it probably did), the door was unexpectedly blasted right off its hinges, making Evil Sonic yelp in surprise as he was carried along by the concrete object\"s weight and ended up being crushed into a pancake underneath it a few feet away. \"Ah-ha! There you are, Ivo!\" As Evil Sonic struggled to re-inflate himself and lift what used to be the door off his back, the dust around the entryway settled, revealing a smiling Fleetway Super Sonic, much to the Eggman\"s shock. \"What a tough decision... I don\"t know whether to kill you or wreck what you built while you watch first!\" He looked to his right and Ivo saw his eyes widen then his become bigger. \"But first, a bit of remodelling!\" He flew off and, one second later, they heard something that sounded like a cross between a whirlwind and a buzz saw coming from just outside the fortress. Only when the buzzing ceased did Robo-Robotnik gather the nerve to creep to the doorway. When he peered out and to the left, his jaw literally dropped straight to the ground. \"Nnnoooooo!\" AoStH Robotnik\"s horrified cry was heard by all who were not deaf within a ten-mile radius of his position. The golden hedgehog had spun around his statue, effectively re-sculpting it into a fine likeness of his blue form, complete with a thumbs-up. \"Don\"t just stand there!\" AoStH Robotnik turned to and shouted angrily at Metal Sonic, Metal Knuckles and Tails Doll. \"Get him!\" \"We\"d be keen to do that, doctor,\" replied Metal Sonic, \"but I perceive that the likelihood of us emerging the victors, let alone unscathed, is approximately one in an octillion...\" \"Aaaahhhhh!\" Metal Sonic started, his eyes widening and he flew off. \"Oh no! I\"m arriving, Breezie!\" Metal Knuckles groaned loudly in frustration while he looked to the skies as if imploring for help and took off after the lovesick robot to prevent him from being dismantled. \"You let go of me right now or else!\" cried Breezie in a miffed tone as Fleetway Super Sonic lifted her up by the collar of her dress. \"Yeah, you big bully!\" added Robotnik Junior as he heatedly shook a fist at him, helpless to do anything else. \"Put her down!\" \"\"Put her down?'\" mimicked the shining Sonic malevolently as he noticed the rapidly approaching Metal Sonic. \"If you say so!\" With that, he hovered down to the android\"s level, spun around and threw Breezie forcibly into him, sending them both crashing into Metal Sonic then Metal Knuckles then Tails Doll and, finally, AoStH Robotnik himself, with all of them ending up in a heap. Despite this, Robotnik Junior picked himself up, holding Breezie in his arms, exclaiming, \"Hey! We\"re okay!\" \"Which is more than I can say for these four bozos,\" put in the aqua-coloured hedgehog as she looked down with an almost bored expression at the three dazed robots and struggling human under their combined weight. Coconuts, Scratch and Grounder, who had been cowering behind an embankment, couldn\"t help but be impressed... Particularly due to the fact that they didn\"t like their ex-master and their replacements. They promptly each held up signs that displayed the numbers \"ten,' \"eight point seven\" and \"point six\" (the last one was being held upside down). \"Yo, Stupid Sonic!\" yelled SatAM Sonic cheekily, succeeding in capturing Fleetway Super Sonic\"s attention and startling the other good Sonics with his bravado. \"I\"ll bet you can\"t catch me!\" Fleetway Super Sonic sneered. \"Are you betting your life by any chance? \"Cause that\"s what you\"re about to lose!\" He shot downward, hit SatAM Sonic with the force of a bullet train and proceeded to pummel him into the ground with his fists, each blow harder than the last. But he had barely hit him six times when there was a sudden illumination and everyone, including Fleetway Super Sonic, found themselves blown three meters away from SatAM Sonic. When the light had died down just enough for them to see what was going on, they uncovered their eyes...and beheld a stunningly miraculous sight. There, hovering where SatAM Sonic was, was another Super Sonic, yet different from the other one; a genuine smile was on his face and his eyes had visible red irises. His grin becoming wider at the sight of Fleetway Super Sonic\"s face, he merely spoke one thing. \"Gotcha.\" \"Ladies and gentlemen, fans of all ages, turn on your video recorders, get out the popcorn and place all of your bets on who you\"ll think will come out the winner \"cause this is one brawl you\"ll probably never ever see again!\" As one, the Omochao started to act like commentators and the fans did exactly what they suggested with some interspersed cheering and whooping. \"Okay, can somebody explain to me just what happened that made SatAM Sonic able to transform into Super Sonic when he\"s stressed?\" enquired Tiffany to no-one in particular out loud. \"Easy,\" said Irene, her face buried in a novel. \"Do you remember when SatAM Sonic and Sally used the Deep Power Stones to destroy Doomsday (\"Doomsday\")?\" \"Yeah.\" \"An unforeseen effect was that, afterwards, every time Sonic becomes stressed, critically injured or exposed to huge amounts of Chaos Energy, he transforms into Super Sonic. Luckily for the Freedom Fighters (and possibly Ixis Naugus), however, he is not at all evil.\" \"Ohhhh,\" articulated Tiffany in comprehension. A moment later, her eyes enlarged; a thought had occurred to her. \"Hey, wait a second, does that mean S...?\" \"Are they capable of killing?\" interrupted Lance. \"This is the Sonicverse of Jocularity after all.\" \"It\"s hard but it\"s not impossible,\" affirmed Flynn. \"Many times, JocuSonic and his pals are threatened with death. And a few robots have been permanently destroyed before, like the Music Destroyer (\"Sonic\"s Song\").\" \"We\"ll just have to wait and see,' wrote Mavis. Fleetway Super Sonic was livid. How dare one of those weaklings make himself resemble him even more so! \"Why you...! That\"s it! I\"m really gonna make you suffer!\" He punched SatAM Super Sonic but all that did was force him away a few feet. SatAM Super Sonic did nothing but smirk. \"You\"ll have to do much better than that. Now bring it on!\" \"You\"ve got it, twit!\" Without delay, they were at each others\" throats. And they were moving so fast, it was pointless for the others to try and see what they were doing exactly. From one point to another, they zoomed about exchanging and dodging blows and, at the same time, inadvertently decimating the new factories and warehouses, much to Robo-Robotnik\"s chagrin, of course. \"Aaargh! Those rodents are ruining everything!\" yelled Robo-Robotnik in frustration with his fists balled up as he stood in the doorway, surveying the destruction. \"At this rate, they\"ll come after us when they\"re done in two minutes!\" \"All is not lost, father,\" stated Mecha calmly, looking over his shoulder. \"We can simply move on to another parallel universe and take the newly Roboticized Mobians and most of the other robots with us.\" \"What!\" shouted Robo-Robotnik in confused annoyance. \"Let me explain, father; our increased numbers will make it easier to conquer the next one while we leave some troops behind to hold ground. By the time we\"re done with the other dimensions, our forces shall have enough strength to overpower this world\"s Freedom Fighters.\" \"Hmmm...\" murmured Robo-Robotnik, placing his non-existent chin in the palm of one of his hands. \"...You\"re right, M. We shall make preparations at once to depart!\" He marched back inside and barked, \"ADAM! Power up the teleportation devices! We\"re leaving for this world...!\" Meanwhile, as you probably might have guessed, Fleetway Super Sonic and SatAM Super Sonic were still combating, neither gaining nor losing ground to the other. After a while, they both ended up on the ground, pushing against each others\" hands with their own. \"Is this the best you can do, tall, bright and handsome?\" joked SatAM Super Sonic cockily. \"No. This is, you soft-hearted, namby-pamby, good-for-nothing!\" Fleetway Super Sonic retaliated. He instantly threw a sucker punch at his rival which sent SatAM Super Sonic crashing headlong into the wall of an adjacent warehouse. SatAM Super Sonic\"s head emerged from the rubble inside the warehouse...and saw Sally and Professors Von Schlemmer and Caninestein staring at him, armed with weapons that resembled the Robo-Transmogrifiers, yet were white instead of grey. And standing beside them were a group of confused Mobians, all wondering how they had gotten there. Before he could ask them what they were doing (although he had a pretty good idea), Fleetway Super Sonic came barrelling through the new gap...and spotted the Mobians. \"Oh ho! More victims!\" he stated gleefully and zoomed toward them. \"Oh no, you don\"t!\" SatAM Super Sonic slammed into the demented being with all his might, forcing the both of them away from the panicky Mobians and into the shaft of a descending stairwell. They actually rolled down the stairs for a couple of seconds until they managed to hover upright again. Fleetway Super Sonic subsequently kicked SatAM Super Sonic down the stairs and out of sight. \"Ha ha ha! This is fun!\" he cackled. He followed him to the bottom but saw that he was nowhere in sight in the spacious room. \"Alright, you coward,\" growled Fleetway Super Sonic in frustration. \"Come out, come out, wherever you are!\" \"Hey, you. Look up.\" He did so and was immediately hit by a spinning SatAM Super Sonic. They both crashed downwards through six floors before the evil hedgehog managed to shove the good hedgehog off of him. \"That\"s it! I\"m gonna tear you apart once and for all!\" \"I don\"t wanna hurt you too badly, bud, but I guess I have no choice.\" And so the two hedgehogs continued to fight...completely unaware of a third person in the gymnasium-sized room, lurking in the shadows. A certain individual clothed in purple regarded them. She picked up what appeared to be two Power Rings the size of hula hoops, both connected to ropes of energy that went through a hole in the wall, and gracefully tossed them towards the duelling Super hedgehogs. \"I apologize most sincerely should this hurt you, Sonics,\" she said. SatAM Super Sonic and Fleetway Super Sonic had only a few seconds to register the fact that two gigantic golden rings had been flipped onto their bodies and squeezed around them before pain equivalent to that of receiving an electric shock coursed through their bodies. A \"Gah!\" escaped the Super Sonics\" lips but only for a moment; they refused to acknowledge to each other that they were in pain as they struggled to free themselves from the constricting objects. Through the haze of pain, both hedgehogs managed to look down and laid their eyes on a peculiar figure: a female person that was most definitely a human; they could see white skin but no fur. She was clothed in a long-sleeved shirt and pair of pants, both of which were purple, loose-fitting and separated by a large sky blue satin ribbon wrapped around her waist. A pair of brown boots made of cloth adorned her feet while a hat that vaguely resembled a tuque with a violet, wrinkled top and sky blue rim sat atop her head, completely obscuring her hair from sight. Weirdly enough, she was faintly hunched over and had her hands firmly clasped over her ears. The sky blue cloth that was covering her mouth was moving slightly but rapidly and her eyes were squeezed shut. Six more excruciating seconds passed and the rings and the chains of energy suddenly disintegrated. The now azure hedgehogs dropped to the floor in a heap. Seconds later, the other noble Sonics came. \"Hey, are you guys alright?\" asked Sonic X concernedly as he bent over them. \"Yeah...\" mumbled Fleetway Sonic while he and SatAM Sonic stood up. \"But did I hurt anyone?\" \"Nah...\" AoStH Sonic casually said then he grinned. \"...except for my world\"s Robuttnik and the three copybots. ...Wait a sec, you don\"t remember?\" \"No... I can never recall what I did as Super Sonic. We\"re practically two different people.\" \"But I can. Hey, you!\" SatAM Sonic pointed dramatically at the person who had just caused him and Fleetway Sonic so much pain. \"What was the big idea?\" \"This was,\" she answered quietly and punched a large claret button on the wall behind her. Disintegrating before their very eyes, the wall uncovered behind it a humongous black egg the size of an eight-story building that was shaking tremendously. The Sonics simply did nothing but stare at the gigantic object with gaping mouths. \"Sheesh, just when you think Eggman can\"t get any more obsessed with eggs...\" muttered SEGA Sonic out loud. \"I\"m afraid,\" interrupted the young woman who was leaning against the wall, making the hedgehogs temporarily look at her, \"that that is not the case.\" A sharp crack brought back their attention to the ovular item and they immediately saw that deep fissures were beginning to spread across the surface, several red glows shining from them. \"Now why am I getting a very bad feeling about this?\" said SU Sonic sarcastically. At almost that exact millisecond, the crimson light grew more intense and the room became quite a bit hotter. Boom! With a bang to make the ground shake, the shell exploded outward into a trillion pieces, raining the Sonics with fine dust. The hedgehogs closed and covered their eyes to avoid getting blinded by the ever brighter ruby luminosity that flashed but for a few seconds then faded away to a dull glow. Figuring it was safe to do so, the insectivores opened their eyelids and lowered their hands - and met with an incredible sight. Standing where the egg was, was a colossal red bird with orange vertical highlights on its abdomen. Atop its head could be seen a crest of six maroon feathers arranged in two rows of three, the tips coming down to the top of its folded wings, the tips of them in turn reaching the base of five tail feathers. The beak was gold and shaped like a starling\"s long bill, though its feet were accipitrine - like a predatory bird\"s. But it was the softly glowing, yellow eyes with no visible pupils that were spine-chilling; especially since they gave the impression that it was forever glaring. \"Wwooowwwww.\" \"Ooooohh.\" \"Coo-hoo-hoo-hool!\" Nearly every Sonic Fan who was witnessing the events was struck by awe at the appearance of such a beautiful creature and, thus, could not help but articulate on the bird\"s splendour. All Chao however were, much to the humans\" ignorance, staring in stark shock at the being on the screens, eyes wide and jaws nearly touching the floor. They stayed like that for a few minutes then huddled together in little groups, whispering something fervently. \"I take it that\"s the reason, then: that huge cardinal.\" The three Chao nodded vigorously at Shin Sonic. \"Okay then. Here we go!\" He grabbed a nearby cable, disconnected it and leapt off the girder, swinging in an arc towards his target. His partner neatly somersaulted onto his back but the bird hardly noticed; he was free at last! He gazed downward and saw the eight similar hedgehogs staring at him; he glared right back. Then, as one, they spun and tried to ram into him. Pitiful weaklings, he thought. He threw his head back then forward just as quickly, releasing a stream of fire from his beak which enveloped the hedgehogs. They instantaneously dropped to the ground on their feet, their spines ablaze. Panicking, they each tried various methods to put out the fire. He felt another weight join the one already present on his back. Peering around, he saw his associate staring at another blue hedgehog, who was accompanied by...by...by... (here, his glare intensified)...three hateful, worldly Heralds. He quickly tilted his head back and subsequently snapped it forward, releasing a searing blast of fire once again. His colleague ducked (not that it would have harmed her) while the azure hedgehog and the Heralds, not prepared for that attack, were blasted backwards right through the wall! His fire breath instantaneously ceased. He hoped the Heralds had gotten incinerated. He didn\"t care whether or not the cobalt hedgehog was dead; he was just collateral damage after all. Looking upward, he saw the ceiling a few meters away from his head. Above that by several floors, he knew, was the sky. He folded his wings tightly against his body, bent his legs and launched himself skyward, spinning and smashing through the multiple ceilings like an immense, red drill until he crashed through the roof and could see the clouds and the sun. As he stopped spinning, a fairly familiar voice from the other end of the field of wrecked factories and warehouses (thanks to his superb hearing) prompted him to turn his superior eyesight in that direction. There, he could see two robots, a puppet and... ...him. Everybody gasped as the bird let out a screech, this time of anger, and suddenly burst into flames. Nevertheless, the redness of the fire could not compare with its eyes, which were now a deep blood red. It looked at AoStH Robotnik again and, with a mighty flapping of its wings, took off after him. The minute that thing looked at him, AoStH Robotnik knew he was in ever so much trouble. \"Oh no... You three,\" he said to Metal Sonic, Metal Knuckles and Tails Doll \"divert that bird\"s attention!\" He made a break for it. Without hesitation, the three automatons took to the air, ready to defend their master. Yet they were no match for the bird, who simply swiped at them with a talon, instantly reducing them to a pile of nuts, bolts and (in Tails Doll\"s case) cotton. AoStH Robotnik kept on running (which was, for him, a considerable feat) \"til that thing flew in front of him. It backed up then proceeded to dive-bomb AoStH Robotnik. Paralyzed with fear at this point, AoStH Robotnik gulped and closed his eyes. It seemed this was the end for him. And he didn\"t even get to take back his fortress or defeat that meddling hedgehog! A sound like a squeal of braking tires prompted him to reopen his eyes...which were met with a frightful sight. The bird was crouching over him, its beak so close, he could feel its very hot breath. The flames surrounding its body had died down somewhat and there was a look of confusion in its orange eyes. If AoStH Robotnik could summon the courage to look down, he would have seen the deep, short grooves in the dirt right behind the bird\"s feet."]}

He stood facing away from the blocked path. \"Ready, everyone?\" He didn\"t look back, but he felt his friends nodding behind him. Alfred took in a deep breath. \"Do it, Arthur.\" The dome exploded. Alfred\"s companions scrambled to their feet and ran behind him, hauling any dazed guards out of the way. Using the chaos as an advantage, Alfred focused. He held out both his hands. The guards charged forward, swiftly regaining their bearings. They were aiming straight at the American, until they hit a solid wall of blinding light. Black spots danced in Alfred\"s eyes from the impact, but he held his concentration. He absolutely will not let himself waver. Making an opening in a pile of rubble and boulders was easier said than done. The Gifted teens were all exhausted, for one thing. They\"d been running for god-knows how long, and their stamina was not everlasting. Still, they refused to give up. \"We\"ll have to be careful,\" Kiku warned as they pondered whether to just blast the thing down with their Gifts or move the boulders one by one. \"Or it will collapse on top of us.\" \"Starting from the top then?\" Antonio suggested, scratching his head. \"Too much time,\" Ludwig glanced behind. Alfred\"s expression was tight with concentration. Sweat beaded his forehead. \"Alfred can\"t last that long.\" Arthur was silent in thought for a moment. \"Ivan.\" The tall Russian boy regarded him sideways. \"Yes?\" \"Do you think you can make a frozen patch wide enough for three of us to go through at a time?\" Ivan studied the pile before them. \"..I can try.\" While Ivan worked, Arthur turned to Ludwig. \"Can you morph the air into a blade sharp enough to cut through that?\" He pointed at the pile. \"I could do it myself but since Alfred\"s using his Gift...\" He needn\"t finish that thought. Everyone knew they daren\"t use the Gifts of light and darkness at the same time. Ludwig furrowed his brows. \"I guess so.\" \" I guess I\"ll be the one to push the block of frozen stone out of the way?\" Elizaveta spoke up, flexing her shoulders. Arthur nodded. \"We\"ll help you.\" \"Thanks,\" Despite her headstrong personality, Elizaveta knew her limits. \"I\"m going to need that.\" From where he stood, Alfred was vaguely aware of what his friends were doing. The hairs on his back stood up from the cold emitted from Ivan\"s gift. For one second, Alfred had difficulty inhaling, and he almost panicked. But he soon realized that it was only Ludwig manipulating air. Alfred staggered as another group of guards charged his wall of light. His arm ached. His vision was blurring. His consciousness was slipping. No. Not yet. Alfred bit his lip hard. He will not give up again. Meanwhile, Ludwig had successfully cut the frozen boulders. He and Ivan stood back while the others took their positions. Arthur and the others pressed their shoulders against the smooth surface, ignoring the cold that seeped through the thin material of the rags they wore. \"Heave ho!\" And they pushed for all they were worth. Even with Elizaveta\"s strength, it was difficult to move the frozen block. The veins on their necks stood out as they strained to make it move. Arthur was sure he would dislocate his shoulder soon enough. With one last mighty push and a loud yell of defiance, the block of frozen boulders budged. The momentum it gained helped more than the strength of Arthur and the others. It slid out easily, leaving a rectangular hole. Judging from the cheers, Alfred guessed they did it. He shouted over his shoulder; \"You guys go first! I\"ll be right behind!\" His companions did not argue. They slipped through warily, afraid that the boulders would suddenly crumble and bury them. Fortunately, nothing of that sort happened. The other side was clear of guards, too. \"Alfred!\" Arthur called over, being the last one to go. \"Come on!\" Alfred wasn\"t sure he could do that. His legs were stiff. He was so tired. Maintaining that barrier was taking his all. \"..You stupid git!\" He felt Arthur pulling his arm, dragging him along. \"Don\"t just stand there.\" \"The barrier,\" Alfred managed. \"It\"s not gonna last..\" \"We\"re not stupid, Alfred,\" Arthur sighed, but otherwise had a crooked smile on his face. \"We know.\" And as if on cue, the wall of light disappeared, and the place seemed brighter. Many guards tripped, not expecting the sudden disappearance of the force that was holding them back. It was looked slightly comical for some reason. But they recovered soon enough, charging towards the boys. Arthur did not bother to make another wall. The distance between them was enough. The others were ready when he and Alfred slipped through. The block was pushed back into place before the guards could reach them. Ivan covered the area around the block with a sheet of ice about an inch thick. Yao duplicated the block right behind the original one, in case they\"d manage to break through. Alfred was exhausted. His legs gave out under him, but Arthur held on to his arm to keep him from falling. Lovino walked over to help, but Alfred held up a hand to stop him. He was sure the Italian boy was tired too, since he had been using his Gift almost constantly to help the others. \"Fine then,\" Arthur bend down, slinging Alfred\"s arms over his shoulders. He circled his own arms under his heels, keeping him from falling. And he stood up, carrying Alfred on his back. Despite his frail looks, Arthur was strong - Alfred had to admit once more. \"Rest for now,\" he told Alfred. \"We\"ll wake you once we make it outside.\" And with that, they ran towards the sunlight. I AM FINALLY UPDATING /shot erp. THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR THE FOLLOWS AND FAVES AND REVIEWS! ;;A;; I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD ACTUALLY GAIN THAT MANY /shot capslockrageftw/shotdead I have nothing else to say other than sorry excuses for why I\"m updating this so late, and why I feel that I\"ve disappointed you guys in the first part. therefore, I shall now shut up. excuse my mistakes. Hetalia is not mine. Enjoy! Wind rippled through his hair. Alfred struggled to open his eyes. The musty air was gone, he realized, replaced by a fresh breeze. And it was no longer cold. A gentle kind of warmth was spreading over him. Alfred\"s eyes finally snapped open, and he immediately regretted it. The sudden brightness of his surroundings painfully blinded him. Wait. Brightness? Wind? Warmth? Alfred opened his eyes once more, slowly this time. Instead of the stone walls he was expecting to see, he was surrounded by trees and greenery. They were in some kind of clearing in a forest. A bright blue sky spread overhead complete with fluffy clouds and a cheerful sun. Alfred would\"ve spent his whole day staring in disbelief if Arthur hadn\"t decided to intervene. \"Snap out of it, Alfred,\" the Brit hissed. Somehow, he knew Alfred was awake without even having to look. Alfred blinked, trying to return to reality. He jumped off Arthur\"s back and almost stumbled. His legs were still shaking. He took in a deep breath and willed them to stop. It made little difference. \"We have to hurry,\" Arthur said grimly, raising his arms and stretching. Carrying the American wasn\"t exactly an easy feat. \"Those guards won\"t stay behind that pile of boulders forever.\" He needn\"t continue. Alfred knew they were all counting on him, but his brain was conveniently short-circuiting. He couldn\"t think. His instincts weren\"t working. \"Uhh..\" Right. So passing out wasn\"t exactly the best idea in the world. \"Alfred!\" Arthur looked ready to gut him right then right there. \"Wait,\" Ludwig spoke up before he could. \"Something\"s wrong.\" He received lots of weary stares. \"The air,\" he continued. \"It\"s too still.\" Before anyone could give a proper reaction, something whizzed past the side of his face, barely missing by an inch. It flew towards the direction of the forest, but when it reached the spot where the grass of the clearing met with the sandy ground of the woods, it burst into flames and disintegrated into ashes. \"A barrier,\" Alfred gulped. He had to pull himself together. He forced down the panic rising in his chest. They\"d made it this far. He was not going to give up again. Not here, not now. There must be some way out. A hole or something. \"Breeze,\" he muttered, eyes widening as realization hit him. He remembered feeling it when he was half conscious. \"There was a breeze just now.\" But where did it come from? Even when his mind was much clearer, Alfred couldn\"t recall. The ground shook under their feet. The Gifted exchanged nervous glances among themselves. That did not sound good. \"..You think they\"d exploded themselves in?\" Alfred questioned wistfully. He\"d intended to keep a cheery tone, but that came out sounding more like a squeak. He and his friends were exhausted from all the running, fighting and excitement. If there was to be another army of guards after them, Alfred wasn\"t sure they would be as lucky to survive again. \"No,\" Arthur just had to confirm his fears. Droplets of sweat trailed down the side of his face. \"They\"re coming.\" The group glanced around, searching for any possible signs for an opening in the invisible barrier. None of them were looking forward to be turned into charcoal, but none of them wanted to be confined to those dark, cold cells again either. They had all decided that they just had to escape no matter what. Because if they were to be caught again.. no, forget about it. \"Come on,\" Alfred gritted his teeth, his azure blue eyes darting around. \"Blow already you stupid wind.\" And then he felt it. The soft caress on his cheeks. The slight shifting of his hair. Alfred turned almost a full circle, and a grin promptly spread across his face. \"There!\" he pointed. His comrades followed his gaze and squinted, struggling to make out what exactly he\"d seen. It took some effort, but they managed to make out the ripple in the air, as if it was a portal that led somewhere - which, in this case, probably did. But it was far, too far for Alfred\"s liking. He estimated it to be about thirty metres from where they stood, and if the guards really were to come soon, things would get very, very complicated. No time to think. \"We have to run!\" Alfred yelled, motioning everyone to move. It all happened too fast. One second they were all sprinting towards the direction of distortion in the barrier. The next, they found themselves face to face with yet another army. Alfred muttered a string of curses. Why does this keep on happening? Sheesh! The group retreated several steps, unprepared and surprised. Alfred realized with a start that they\"d appeared out of thin air. He swiftly swept his gaze across the armoured men before him. There weren\"t as much as before - about only forty or so. Some were wielding weapons. Most weren\"t. Alfred decided not to care about that yet. He had enough trouble coming up with a good strategy that could keep them all alive. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up. The air was tinged with the smell of ozone. Out of nowhere, someone yelled, \"Lightning!\" Alfred\"s body moved before his mind could process the situation. They split into two groups and jumped opposite directions. Alfred caught a glimpse of the bolt that shot down from the sky right on the spot where they stood seconds ago, cackling with energy and electricity. A thunderclap followed right after, rattling his brain in his skull. Great. They pull off cool things like playing with light and darkness; controlling fire, ice and wind; and speaking into people\"s mind and here these people are trying to fry them with lightning. Alfred finally understood why Arthur had said that things were only just starting when they were back in the mining area. They Gifted guards were not in action yet. They\"ve got no choice. Alfred turned to a very terrified looking Mei. \"Hey, Mei?\" he whispered, trying to keep his tone calm for her sake. \"I\"m so sorry, but can you do me a favour?\" Mei bit her lip to steel her shaky nerves and nodded. Alfred prayed that none of those guards possess the Gift of super hearing. \"Tell Arthur that we\"ll stay split up. Ask him to lead his group around the guards instead of facing them head on. We\"ll do the same and we\"ll regroup outside.\" Mei nodded once more to show that she understood. She closed her eyes and concentrated, projecting her voice into Arthur\"s mind. Alfred and the others stood guard. He noticed that they weren\"t being attacked. The guards stared at them. Somewhere, in Alfred\"s mind, something clicked into place. These people were Gifted too. They understood their need for freedom. They had probably gone through the same thing before they grew old enough to be promoted into serving as guards. Alfred got the feeling that they did not want this any more than they do. Alfred considered talking to them. He could be pretty convincing at times. But one look at those lifeless eyes behind the chinks of metal, he got the feeling he would need more than convincing power. His gaze briefly met Arthur\"s. The Brit nodded slightly to show that he understood the plan, and Alfred responded with a shaky grin. He tried passing a message to him with his eyes, hoping that it would reach him. On the count of three. Arthur nodded once more. He turned to the adolescents of his group, and quickly passed them the orders. Alfred inhaled. \"One.\" The guards shifted their position, wary of the countdown. Alfred went on, bracing himself to run. \"Two.\" Please let this work. Please, please, please.. \"Three!\" All at once, they broke into a sprint; Alfred\"s group one way, Arthur\"s the other. The guards seemed to have anticipated this, but Alfred and his friends couldn\"t care less. They were too busy madly dodging the attacks thrown at them and wrenching themselves out of the grip of the hands trying to grab them. But Alfred noticed another thing: it was all half-hearted, as if the guards were just doing it for show. The grips on their clothes or limbs were not strong and they could easily pull free. The attacks thrown at them were missing them by miles most of the time. Were they really..? \"Alfred!\" Athur\"s group had already reached the front of the distortion. \"Go!\" Alfred yelled. \"We\"ll catch up!\" Arthur looked hesitant at first, but his expression slowly hardened. He nodded towards his group, and leaped in. The others followed suit. They were almost there. Alfred glanced behind him to make sure he still had everyone with him, before yelling out energetically; \"Come on guys! Let\"s get out of here!\" and putting one last burst of speed. They made it past the last few metres without any obstacles. Alfred made his comrades go through first, in case anything would happen. Nothing did. The guards only stood and watch as they disappeared outside the barrier. Alfred said a silent thank you before he too, made his way through the distortion and into the world outside where freedom awaits. Alfred instantly discovered why they couldn\"t be found after they were kidnapped. He\"d turned around as soon as he leaped through the opening, and the clearing was nowhere to be seen. All he saw was another part of the forest. That was the good part. The bad part was - Alfred realized with a start - that it was too silent. No cheers of triumph. No shouts of joy. No shuffling of feet. Alfred was alone. Panic began rising in his chest as he searched around frantically. No sign of any other human beings. No, no, no. This can\"t be happening. Where was everyone? Were they separated? Alfred forced himself to calm down, but it was difficult with all the possibilities swirling in his mind. He did not like even one of them. Was he the only one separated? Or were each and every one of them scattered all over the place? Or was he not the only one but just a few others as well? \"Calm down,\" he told himself firmly. He tried thinking with rational. \"I must go straight,\" he decided. \"I must go as far away from here as I can. There\"s a bigger chance for me to find them if I stay close to a source of water. I must find a river. I must go somewhere higher.\" Indeed he was the only separated from the rest of the group as something had definitely gone wrong with the barrier when he passed through. Alfred too, had made the right decision by prioritizing the need to find a higher spot and water source. But one thing Alfred did not know, was that he was going the exact opposite way from where he would meet Arthur and the others. \"Alfred!\" Out of the dozens of voices calling for their missing friend, Arthur\"s was one of the loudest. They searched high and low, but to no avail. Alfred\"s existence seemed to have disappeared altogether. The invisible barrier behind their backs did not make matters any easier. It was messing with their usage of their Gifts. Mei was their only hope at one point, but she\"d regretfully told them that her powers could only extend to a certain radius, and that she couldn\"t reach him. Which only meant that Alfred had ended up somewhere very far from them. Arthur chewed his lower lip in thought. He contemplated whether or not to set out and search for Alfred immediately. He briefly surveyed the Gifted adolescents around him, and easily came to a conclusion. No. They were too tired. The Vargas brothers looked like they would faint any time soon. Ludwig and Antonio were getting paler and paler by the minute. The others - including Arthur himself, were bruised up pretty badly. \"We\"ll look for him later,\" he said. When he got stares of disbelief, he added, \"Alfred will know how to look after himself. We\"ll rest and rejuvenate first. I know you\"re all tired.\" \"But Arthur-kun!\" Surprisingly, Kiku was the first one to protest. \"Alfred-kun might be in danger this very minute. If we don\"t - \" \"But there\"s no point if we\"re all tired out and weak, is there?\" the Brit replied calmly. \"I dread doing this too, but we have no choice. God knows how long it\"ll take us to find him.\" When he saw the solemn faces of his comrades, Arthur couldn\"t help smiling crookedly to himself. Alfred really was amazing. He was their newest member, yet he was the one that was liked most by everyone. Arthur knew he would never be able to do that. He would never be able to make so many people like him. \"Hey, don\"t worry,\" he said when the silence became too suffocating. \"We\"ll look for him. I promise. But first thing\"s first,\" he glanced around. \"We need to find somewhere safe to set up a camp.\" As soon as that came out from his mouth, Arthur realized he had no idea where to start. He had been imprisoned in that coal mine since he was a barely a five years old, and he did not exactly come outside often. Or at all, for that matter. Despite his attempts to lead, he had not the slightest idea on how to carry out his plans. Thankfully, he was spared of embarrassment when Ludwig decided to take over. The German boy stepped forward, letting his gaze travel all around him. He unconsciously let a sigh escape his lips. He hadn\"t been dumped in a forest for a long time, and he knew his skills must have gone rusty. He was so darned tired from running too. But all that didn\"t matter. He saw Arthur\"s face when the realization sank in. He knew the outside world wasn\"t exactly the British boy\"s forte. Arthur barely knew the things about the cities of the modern world, let alone undeveloped forests such as the one they\"re in now. Like it or not, Ludwig would have to take over for the mean time. \"First, we\"ll have to get out of here,\" he announced. \"As far away as we can. We should then look for a part of the forest where the greenery is thinner and settle down. We\"ll find food and water when the time comes.\" He looked around. \"Does anyone have anything to add? Or other ideas?\" None. \"Well then,\" Ludwig huffed. \"Let\"s get going.\" Alfred had no idea how long he\"d been walking. His bare feet were cut and blistered badly. They ached with every step he took. His muscles were on fire. He tilted his head skywards. He thanked whichever deity that was listening for granting him a fairly cloudy day. The afternoon sun was not scorching, but it did not look like it was going to rain anytime soon either. This forest goes on forever, part of him complained. The next time he saw a fallen tree nearby, his brain made no protests to take a short rest. He figured his legs would break if he kept on going. He sank down on the rough surface of the tree bark, slowly bending his stiff legs. Once he was seated, he reached over, and attempted to massage his sore leg muscles, tendons, ligaments, and basically whatever his legs were made up of. Alfred studied his feet. The cuts were superficial, but it was the blisters that he was worried about. He had one about the size of a ping pong ball on the base each foot. Alfred was tempted to pop them, but he knew better than to do so since it might cause an infection and he might lose his whole leg as a result later. Alfred heaved a sigh. He regretted not thinking about the possibilities of being stuck in this kind of situation earlier. At least he would\"ve been mentally prepared. Now, sitting there alone, he felt like a lost child; afraid, alone, and without any idea on where he is.", "It barely had time to take off into the air again before Taiga dived back under and headed straight towards the shore of the human settlement. Furious wouldn\"t even describe what he was feeling at the moment in the least. Lava bubbled up from the pit of his stomach, threatening to erupt in one terrible explosion at the slightest push. Taiga had been holding himself back all this while because Tetsuya was seemingly doing fine by himself. He monitored his condition through his seagull friend whom he\"d asked to report to him if anything were to happen in return for a month\"s supply of good fish. He\"d also found out about the group of humans who liked to harm Tetsuya that way. Taiga knew his actions were akin to spying, but with Tetsuya unwilling to tell him a thing, he had no choice. Taiga came to a stop a little away from the scene; his hands shaking, his breathing coming out in uneven breaths at his attempt to control himself. He hated these humans. Loathed them. How dare they hurt Tetsuya? How dare they make him go through that again? He wanted to hurl himself at them, to tear them apart and feed their insides to the eyeless creatures of the deep sea. He wanted to rend, to rage, to stain his own two hands with their blood and serve as a living reminder to anyone who dared mess with Tetsuya that this was what\"s going to happen if they went too far. But the merfolk had one strict rule above all, and that was to never, ever, harm humans. Taiga was taught that bloodshed would only lead to bloodshed, and his people could not afford to make the human race their enemy. They were to continue staying in hiding while living as a myth to the two-legged people on land and nothing more. Do not involve yourself with the humans. Do not hurt them and they will not hurt you. Taiga placed his fingers to his lips, and blew; a long, sharp whistle unheard to those illiterate to the language of the sea. And as he waited, he watched. He watched with increasing frustration and helplessness as Tetsuya struggled for breath, struggled to break free, struggled to keep himself from going insane with fear. Taiga clenched his fists, his fingernails digging deep enough into the flesh of his palms to draw blood. He couldn\"t betray his people any more than he can betray Tetsuya, but he couldn\"t just sit tight and watch while he waited for reinforcements to come. Not ever. Not after what Tetsuya had been through and was going through again. He\"d promised himself that he\"d never let him go through that again, never let him fear the sea again. Taiga was about to make a decision that could\"ve made both Tetsuya and his people hit him for being a rash idiot when he felt something brushing against his arm. He turned, and felt a grin making its way to his lips despite the circumstances. \"Hey, thanks for coming.\" ... Tetsuya couldn\"t see, couldn\"t breathe. Couldn\"t breathe. He couldn\"t breathe. The memories he\"d worked so hard to bury in the depths of his mind and forget in order to continue his life on the sea came flooding back in an instant, numbing his senses, freezing his limbs. He held his breath as long as he could, tried to inhale when he was pulled back from the water for those split seconds. His heartbeat was almost loud enough to drown out the sound of the waves, the gleeful laughter. The terrified screaming. Wait. The screaming? \"-ark!\" Abruptly, Tetsuya felt the iron grips around him let go. He straightened at once and sputtered seawater from his nose and mouth, breathing heavily. He turned around as he willed his legs to keep holding him upright, the sight of four figures running off at full speed back towards land catching his attention. What did they scream before they fled? Ark? Shark. The part of his mind that miraculously still worked told him that was pure nonsense. There was no way a shark would swim to such shallow waters. They must\"ve made a mistake. Tetsuya was completely convinced that they were just high with the excitement of the moment to think there was actually a shark heading towards them until he noticed the dorsal fin. Tetsuya felt his heart stop beating for a moment. He wasn\"t bleeding anywhere, was he? Standing very still, his eyes followed the fin that cut smoothly through the water and circled around him. Had scabs formed on the cuts on his arms? Was it going to eat him here and now? He nearly jumped out of his skin when he felt something touching the back of his leg, flinching so hard that he was sure the shark would\"ve bitten him already. \"It\"s okay! He doesn\"t feel like eating anytime soon.\" Amazing how Tetsuya felt himself relax the moment he heard the familiar, comforting voice. He looked down, and Taiga waved at him from below the waves, a triumphant smile on his face. \"How did you know?\" Tetsuya asked rather than thanking him, much to Taiga\"s chagrin. The latter decided he was stupid to have expected to be thanked in the first place, and shrugged. \"I had a friend keep an eye on you,\" he said, ignoring the look Tetsuya shot him after registering his words. \"You can\"t expect me to sit back and do nothing when you\"re clearly in trouble.\" \"What if someone sees you?\" Tetsuya shot back, and Taiga noticed he was still very careful not to make any sudden movements because of the shark encircling them as if being on guard. \"Relax - I\"ve got that covered,\" Taiga dismissed carelessly, swimming to join the shark. He petted the giant fish affectionately. \"That aside, why don\"t you say hi to this big guy?\" Tetsuya had no idea what made him comply. He looked the shark in the eye, and greeted him in his usual polite way. \"Good evening.\" \"Ohh, you can speak the language of the sea?\" A gravelly sort of voice echoed in the back of his mind, similar to how Taiga\"s would when they conversed. The shark sounded fascinated, though his black eyes remained blank as canvas. \"Apparently,\" Tetsuya replied, feeling the tension in his body tentatively ebbing away. \"Thank you so much for helping me.\" \"I just scared them,\" the shark said modestly. \"Besides, Taiga\"s the one you should be thanking.\" Tetsuya honestly preferred not to give the merman anymore encouragement to come to his aid under such risky circumstances, but courtesy compelled him to express his gratitude anyway. \"Thank you very much, Taiga-kun,\" he said, albeit a little too stiffly. \"But please don\"t do this again.\" \"Do what?\" Taiga returned innocently, and Tetsuya sighed. This was probably going to be a problem in the future. Taiga must\"ve seen the look on his face because he barked out a laugh, earning him weird stares from his two companions. \"I don\"t think I\"ll need to save you again from those fish-crap, if that\"s what you\"re thinking,\" he said wanly, the amused smile not leaving his lips. \"Heck, I doubt they\"ll even dare come near the sea anymore after today.\" Tetsuya kept quiet and averted his gaze, and Taiga felt a spark of irritation well up within him. Was this how a guy should react when another person went to such great lengths to help him? Even so, he somehow knew Tetsuya was genuinely grateful; he\"s just anxious that he might repeat this reckless feat of his and get endanger himself and the whole merman race in the future. Taiga also guessed it\"d take him nothing less than forever to convince the human boy that he really had taken the necessary precautions to avoid being spotted, so he didn\"t bother. \"You know what? Fine,\" Taiga sighed wearily, willing his annoyance to subside. \"I promise I won\"t do this again. I won\"t swim near here ever again.\" Tetsuya glanced back at him, and Taiga experienced one of those rare moments where he could actually figure out what the former was thinking by his expressions. \"I didn\"t say anything about the rock formation though,\" he added before Tetsuya could start speaking, and grinned when he saw how he visibly relaxed. \"I apologize if I sounded harsh just now,\" Tetsuya told him, and Taiga merely dismissed it with a shake of his head. \"And thank you so much, Taiga-kun.\" \"No problem,\" Taiga replied, then made a shooing motion with his hand. \"Now go home before you catch one of those colds you once told me about.\" Tetsuya nodded. \"Be careful on the way home too, Taiga-kun.\" Once Tetsuya had disappeared from his view, Taiga cursed himself for being too late. Because he once again saw fear in Tetsuya\"s eyes as he stood in the water to speak with him. Tetsuya was afraid of the sea all over again. Taiga stared at the can of.. something Tetsuya was holding out to him. \"Excuse me for asking,\" Taiga cleared his throat before looking up to stare pointedly at the boy. \"But what the hell is this supposed to be?\" \"A token of my gratitude,\" Tetsuya answered with an impossibly straight face, meeting his gaze with those blank eyes of his. \"For saving me the other day.\" \"And..?\" Taiga prompted because he obviously needed a longer explanation than that. Tetsuya turned the can in his hands and studied the label, his expression unchanging. \"It\"s fish food.\" \"I\"m sorry - what?\" Taiga was almost - almost expecting Tetsuya to crack up at his own joke. Unfortunately, he did not. \"Isn\"t that what you humans feed to the poor souls you keep in those glass boxes in your homes?\" \"As a matter of fact, yes.\" \"And may I remind you that I\"m a wild merman and not a pet fish?\" Taiga crossed his arms and gave him a judging look. \"I am not eating that.\" Tetsuya actually dared - dared to look downcast. \"But I went all the way to get you this.\" \"Oh, no. You\"re not going to guilt me. No way.\" Taiga willed himself to look away to avoid his so-called maternal instincts from taking over at the sight of Tetsuya looking so dejected. \"I even got you the premium brand,\" Tetsuya sulked softly, and despite everything, Taiga found him incredibly childish yet annoyingly adorable. It wasn\"t everyday he got to see this side of Tetsuya, and perhaps it was because of this that he felt his resolve crumbling and getting carried off by the breeze. Just a bite, he swore to himself. \"Okay, okay, I get it.\" Taiga scratched the back of his neck and reached for the can with his free hand. \"Thanks for the meal.\" He picked a piece out of the mush with his fingers and lifted it to his mouth, aware that Tetsuya was watching him with unusually keen interest. Frankly, he\"d expected it to taste like his father\"s homemade pickled seaweed (which is to say, bad) but since it didn\"t trigger his gag reflexes, he guessed it wasn\"t so bad. It\"s edible, to the very least. \"A little too salty for my tastes, but it\"s surprisingly okay?\" Taiga mused while he chewed. \"What is this stuff made of, anyway?\" \"I think it\"ll be better for you not to know, Taiga-kun,\" Tetsuya told him, and Taiga wisely decided to let the topic go. He finished the rest of the fish food in a couple of large gulps and handed the empty can back to Tetsuya to dispose of it properly later when he got home. As the latter moved to set it properly aside so it wouldn\"t get carried into the sea by the waves, Taiga made himself comfortable by resting his head on his crossed legs, staring at the skies above. \"So,\" Taiga started after a short stretch of silence between him and his companion. \"Are those asshats still bothering you?\" \"Hmm, not really,\" Tetsuya replied, absently poking Taiga\"s cheeks with his finger. Taiga tried to swat his hand away, but he was persistent, and the redhead soon gave up. \"Rather, they have this flicker of fear in their faces whenever they look at me now.\" \"Because you survived a shark attack?\" Taiga chuckled, and Tetsuya shrugged, an equally amused smile on his face. \"Perhaps,\" he said before turning sober once more. \"But really. How is it that you managed to stay unseen despite your size?\" He asked this because Taiga was a full-grown, buff, two-meter long merman with blood red hair and a bright red tail that were bound to make him stand out in the colors of the ocean. \"Well.. I might or might not have learnt how to blend with the waves some time ago,\" Taiga said, attempting to be bashful but failing by the second. \"Rather, it\"s a sort of skill all merfolk have to learn in case of emergencies.\" \"I see.\" Tetsuya moved his fingers over the little cluster of scales just above Taiga\"s cheekbones. Other than his tail and sharp teeth, what made the redhead distinctly a merman were the random patches of luminescent scales he had all over his human half and the gills -barely visible when he\"s not in the water- on the sides of his neck. Tetsuya particularly liked the feel of his smooth scales on his fingertips; why so, he did not know. \"It\"s going to rain tomorrow,\" Taiga said a little while later, his attention fixed at the sky. Tetsuya looked up as well, and raised an eyebrow at the lack of clouds. \"How can you tell?\" he asked. Taiga\"s gaze flickered towards him, his features set in a queer look. \"It\"s the sea,\" he answered in a tone that suggested Tetsuya should\"ve known that already. \"She sounds different tonight.\" Tetsuya decided not to doubt him any further. \"Is it going to be a storm?\" \"Not a huge one.\" Taiga shifted into a more comfortable position. \"But it\"ll be long. We probably won\"t be able to meet at all.\" \"You don\"t sound too happy,\" Tetsuya pointed out, the faintest trace of a smile on his lips. \"You think you\"re going to miss me?\" \"Who knows?\" Taiga responded mischievously. \"I just might.\" \"It\"s only for a day, Taiga-kun. I won\"t be going anywhere.\" \"I know.\" Taiga opened his mouth to say more, but paused at the last moment, hesitating. The next thing he was about to blurt out was a little embarrassing, he had to admit. He thought it\"d be best for him not to voice it out lest Tetsuya teases him about him for the rest of his life. \"Don\"t you have any friends down there?\" Tetsuya\"s inquiry tugged Taiga out of his reverie, and the latter refocused his attention to his companion. \"Not many, but yes,\" Taiga told him, curious. \"Why?\" \"Just asking.\" Tetsuya shrugged, and Taiga couldn\"t help but feel there was something more to that. \"Do they know about you coming here?\" \"Only one guy, actually.\" Taiga knitted his eyebrows slightly. \"He\"s the only one I can trust. I\"m not that close to the rest of them so they probably won\"t notice if I\"m gone.\" \"What about your parents?\" Tetsuya asked further, remembering his own parents who\"d utterly freak out if he didn\"t get home by the time he said he\"d get home even though they let him go out into the sea alone. He noticed the change in Taiga\"s gaze when he voiced his question. \"They\"re in another town,\" Taiga said, his tone tinged with wistfulness. \"I live by myself right now.\" \"It must be lonely,\" Tetsuya sympathized, running his fingers through the merman\"s red locks. Taiga shook his head, unperturbed by the way the boy\"s fingers tugged at his hair. \"They left quite recently so it\"s really not that bad,\" he said, then broke into an honest smile. \"Besides, I\"ve got you and your dad to keep me company now.\" \"That\"s not enough and you know it,\" Tetsuya told him dryly. \"It\"s plenty enough to me,\" Taiga said, reaching to brush a lock of Tetsuya\"s soft, blue hair behind his ear. \"Being able to see you is more than enough.\" \"I see,' Tetsuya said, then gently eased the merman off his legs, ignoring the numbness that soon followed. \"That\"s good to hear.\" \"You going to go now?\" Taiga inquired as Tetsuya struggled to stand up without his legs giving way. Tetsuya nodded, bunching parts of his shorts to wring them dry. Taiga didn\"t bother pointing out that he was a little early that night. \"Well, okay. Be careful on your way home.\" \"You too, Taiga-kun. Good night.\" With small wave, Tetsuya turned around, and started making his way home. Taiga too, dove into the sea and began his journey back. Neither of them noticed how red the other\"s face was when they looked away. \"Hey, Ryouta? Can I ask you something?\" The said person turned to face Taiga, eyebrows raised. Ryouta was a merman with short blonde hair and a golden tail and was gorgeous even in merfolk standards. Now that Taiga thought of it, it did seem a little odd that someone as popular and attractive as Ryouta to hang out with someone as painfully normal as him. Though attractive as he was, Ryouta could, at times, be quite annoying because he got excited easily and was able to blabber on about something for hours on end. It irked Taiga that he was the only person he trusted enough to confide in about the matter. \"Hmm? What is it?\" Ryouta tilted his head in question. Taiga scratched the back of his neck and hesitated to continue because really, the topic will be embarrassing as hell especially when he practically already knew how the blond was going to react. \"H-How does - umm-\" Taiga\"s stammering alone was enough to make him feel mortified. He clenched his fists, and willed himself to man the heck up. He wasn\"t some sort of girly maiden for Pete\"s sake! \"How does falling in love feel like?\" The way Ryouta\"s features lighted up the second the words left his lips made Taiga immediately regret ever being born. \"Taigacchi\"s thinks he\"s in love?\" he muses excitedly and Taiga was just a step away from burying himself into the sand and staying there till he became a fossil. \"Oh, my god! Who\"s the lucky girl?\" \"Just answer the question,\" Taiga grumbled with his arms crossed, hating himself already for the way his cheeks were burning right then. Ryouta outright refused to do so and instead indulged himself in his fanboying a minute longer, rolling around in the water while fantasizing about the redhead\"s potential mate. Taiga was just about to decide on punching him and swimming off when he finally calmed down and apologized playfully. \"Okay, okay, I\"m sorryyyy!\" he said, then cleared his throat to regain his composure. \"Let\"s see - how does it feel like to be in love, right?\" Wordlessly, Taiga nodded, still willing the bloodrush in his face to fade. He figured the blond should know about things like this since he was so into those cheesy romance novels and comics. Ryouta was quiet in thought for a few seconds, a look of deep concentration on his face. Taiga also sometimes marveled at how different of a person Ryouta would seem to be when he was serious. Maybe that\"s why so many mermaids had a crush on him. \"Hmm I guess it all starts with you suddenly noticing a lot of things about that person?\" Ryouta started, crossing his arms. \"Even the littlest things like a certain detail in their features or some quirks you never knew they had before. Oh, and of course there\"s the way your heart will beat strangely when you see them and you\"ll feel very bothered for no apparent reason.\" \"Will I have this fierce need to protect them?\" Taiga muttered without realizing it. Fortunately for him, Ryouta did not take it upon himself to tease him. He could tell that Taiga really was putting a lot of thought into this. \"Yeah,\" he affirmed cheerfully. \"And you\"ll also feel that you must make sure they\"re always happy no matter what happens.\" \"I..see,' Taiga trailed off, and Ryouta failed to refrain the smile from creeping to his face at the sight of him. \"Sooo can I know who\"s the one now?\" He swam closer to his companion and prodded, nudging his side with his elbow. \"Is it the mermaid near the coral reef who always brings you the anemones? Or is it the one living near your place who has a garden of cucumbers?\" \"No, not them,\" Taiga denied absently, looking oddly panicky as if coming to a very bad realization. His eyes darted around for a few moments before settling once more on the blond, and Ryouta did not need to be an expert to know that he was truly dismayed by what he had just came to comprehend. \"What should I do?\" \"What do you mean?\" Ryouta asked, beginning to feel nervous himself. He already had a very vague idea of what Taiga was going to say next. He watched in increasing anxiety as Taiga raked his fingers roughly through his hair, looking utterly at loss. \"I think..\" His voice was soft as a whisper when he spoke again, a contrast to his usually obscenely loud tone. \"I think I might be falling for a human.\" Ryouta sucked in a breath, his heart skipping a beat at the drop of the bombshell. He had expected this somewhat, but he was still pretty taken aback. He already had the feeling a while ago that what Taiga felt towards the human boy whom he\"s so attracted so was not mere maternal instinct; not with the way the former\"s eyes sparkled whenever he mentioned him and the way he perked up with excitement when it was time for him to slip out to meet him. Not with how he was willing to endanger both himself and the whole species by meeting him. \"What should I do?\" Taiga muttered again, and Ryouta honestly had no idea how to answer. Common sense told him that falling in love with a human is the worst thing that could happen to a member of the merfolk. Yet, Ryouta could not bring himself to tell his friend to give it up, nor did he have the heart to give him false hopes by telling him to go on with it and deal with things one at the time. He had seen enough to know that despite how many people romanticize it, love cannot conquer all. Taiga had gotten himself into a incredibly difficult situation, and Ryouta did not know how to pull him out of it without hurting him."]}

Behind the desk, an old man in purple robes looked out a window while sunlight streamed in. \"Master, he is fully awake and without haze.\" \"Why have you brought him here?\" \"I found him in the Acre market, rambling about some girl.\" \"Ah. He was dressed oddly, yes?\" \"Yes, sir. He closely resembled the last subject we brought from there, so I brought him here.\" I spoke up: \"The last subject... What did she look like?\" The sentry that had lead me here looked to his master, who nodded. \"It was a young girl, about your age. She was dressed scantily, and had...hair as blue as an azure sky. We brought her here after watching her wander the streets for some time.\" \"You took Rei! I knew it! You bastards! Give her back!\" The master nodded to his subject, who grabbed me as in the market, and I felt something threaten to stab my side again. I quickly stopped yelling, and cast my eyes down. The master approached, bent down, and took my face in his hand, pulling it up to bring my eyes to his. \"You have quite a nerve, boy. What is your name?\" \"Shinji. Shinji Ikari.\" \"I see. And you know this other odd person we took in?\" \"Rei Ayanami. I came here to save her!\" \"That is why you were in Acre? When do you come from?\" \"The twentieth century. Why?\" \"Exactly as she said. Well, boy. We do have this Rei of yours. She is making a rather...exotic addition to our harem. But no doubt you experienced it first hand?\" \"That wasn\"t a dream... Rei told me you\"d let us go if I did what you said. What do you want?\" \"Such disrespect! You speak to the Master of the Hashashin, cur!\" \"The Hashashin? But you guys were... Assassins.\" \"That is what the Christians call us, yes.\" \"What do you want, then?\" \"We want you to us a service in exchange for the return of your woman.\" \"She\"s not my woman... I think.\" \"Nevertheless, you care enough for her to do us a simple service, yes?\" \"Yes, but what is it?\" \"You, my friend, will assassinate King Richard I.\" \"What?\" I was told the specifics of my mission: Richard I was to make a visit to Acre to witness the implementation of Christianity in the region. I would wait for the king to pass by during a royal parade, then approach and kill him as he rode slowly on his horse. I was given everything I needed: A small knife, a sword, throwing knives, and the rest of the outfit my sentry wore. For about a week, I was trained by the Hashashin for the task, dawn to dusk. I knew I couldn\"t refuse; I wanted Ayanami back more than anything. One day, while training with my mentor, Alta\u00efr Ibn La-Ahad, I asked him about my upcoming mission. \"Alta\u00efr, I\"ve got a question.\" \"What is it, Shinji?\" \"You know I\"m from the future, right?\" \"That is what I\"ve been told.\" \"Well, if I kill King Richard I, won\"t it change the future?\" \"I have read about such things, Shinji. The theory we accept states that nothing will change, because in your time period, you have already either succeeded or failed.\" \"So, everything will be the same as when I left?\" \"It more means that everything was the way it was because of what you did now.\" \"You\"re saying there is nothing to gain by not killing him?\" \"Shinji, if you do this, the Master has ways of taking you back to your time period.\" \"And if I do not succeed?\" \"History will not change, but you will die and Rei will become a permanent addition to the harem.\" \"What\"s the harem for?\" \"When we take in a new Assassin, they are drugged and put into a garden, where the harem will fulfill his sexual desires. It\"s a way of keeping people from turning us down. Surely you experienced this?\" \"Something like it, but it was just a blur.\" \"You saw her, though?\" \"Yes, but she didn\"t do what the other girls did.\" \"They are always hesitant at first, but she will soon adjust.\" \"You mean...\" \"I\"m sorry, but yes.\" It was then, mind racked with the horrible thoughts of Rei being used by drug-crazed men, that I made up my mind. I was not going to fail. Author\"s Note: For those of you who haven\"t played Assassin\"s Creed TM, just keep trying. I hope it\"s not too confusing. Either way, let me know what you think so far! I lay in bed one night, after yet more training with Alta\u00efr, thinking about the mission. I was about to fall asleep, but felt an odd presence in the room. \"Alta\u00efr?\" He emerged from the shadows. \"I fear I may have taught you too much... What do you need?\" \"I have a question.\" \"Again? What is it?\" \"Why me? Why am I going to kill Richard?\" \"You are still young. No one would suspect a child. It is thought of as...less than noble.\" \"Oh. Have you assassinated anyone?\" \"Yes. I assassinated nine prominent warmongers, to quiet the crusades.\" \"My history books said you didn\"t change much...\" \"Well, I tried.\" \"Just one more thing...\" \"What?\" \"It\"s about Rei.\" \"I had the pleasure of talking with her earlier. I can see why you love her, Shinji.\" \"But...even if I succeed, when I come back here, will she still feel the same?\" \"How do you mean?\" \"If I take too long, and she...gives herself...to the initiates, will she still want to come back with me?\" \"Hard to tell, Shinji. We don\"t take in that many, especially now. There aren\"t that many targets these days. I think I can make a deal to keep her safe. I\"ll let you know tomorrow.\" \"But tomorrow\"s when I leave for the mission!\" \"You\"ll leave in the evening, I\"ll find out by then. For now, just get some sleep.\" \"Ok...\" I slept soundly that night, tired from training. I now knew all I needed to do my job. I knew how to approach the target, how to kill while keeping a low profile, and how to take to the rooftops. I knew the King would be in Acre, and I knew the Hashashin safe house\"s location where I could wait for the search to be called off. All the pieces were in place. That morning, Alta\u00efr woke me, and lead me to the Master\"s desk in the library. The Master was at the window once again. Alta\u00efr had told me that birds brought him messages through the window, and he was always waiting for news from the outside. \"Master, I\"ve brought Shinji to you as requested. He is trained and ready.\" \"Very good, Alta\u00efr. I will handle it from here. You may return to your business.\" \"Yes, Master.\" Alta\u00efr left swiftly, dropping over the side of the mezzanine. \"Now, Shinji. You are almost ready to go. Is there anything else you need?\" \"I don\"t think so...\" \"Something to eat, maybe?\" \"No... But, can I see Rei one last time before I go?\" \"It is not policy to let them leave the garden.\" \"But... I don\"t have to kill Richard for you. I could kill myself, and then what would you do?\" The Master gave Shinji a dire look, then smiled. \"You still have that gall; not bad, boy. Bring her over!\" Rei was brought over by two other Hashashin. She wore the same clothes as the other girls, and looked beautiful, though out of place. \"Rei!\" She looked up to Shinji, then down again, tears coming to her eyes. \"Shinji, I... I\"m sorry. I didn\"t know what they\"d make you do!\" \"I\"m going to do it, Rei. I\"m going to get you back!\" \"Thank you.\" \"Did...did Alta\u00efr talk to you, Rei?\" \"In fact he did,\" said the Master, walking between the two. \"Alta\u00efr made a deal to take Rei as his own, in return for finding me fifty more initiates.\" \"He...He lied?\" I was ready to burst with rage; the man I trusted took Rei away from me! I looked over to Rei, who seemed to be trying to get my eye-contact. She nodded, and gave me a wink. After some thinking, I realized what was going on. Alta\u00efr was keeping Rei safe until I could get back. \"Alta\u00efr, you son of a bitch. You had me going for a second there.\" \"What was that, boy?\" \"Huh? Oh, nothing. I\"m ready to go, Master.\" \"Even though you know she has given herself up to another?\" \"This is about my devotion to the order, Master.\" \"Very good, Shinji.\" As I left the library for the stables, Alta\u00efr intercepted me. We walked together through the town, heading down the slope towards the gates. \"Shinji, I hope I didn\"t worry you.\" \"That was low, Alta\u00efr.\" \"It had to convince the Master that I was serious. Anything less would be suspicious.\" \"But wait, can\"t I just take Rei now and leave?\" \"You could, but where would you go? You need the Master\"s power to return.\" \"I understand. What now?\" \"Take a horse from the stables, and ride to Acre, following the signposts. Ride slowly when passing by guards, and blend in with scholars and monks to pass through checkpoints. Kill Richard, then immediately take to the rooftops. Good luck, Shinji.\" \"Thank you, Alta\u00efr.\" \"Ride swiftly. I promise to keep my hands off of Rei.\" I put up my hood, and took a horse. Riding through the night helped me to avoid most guard patrols, but there was still danger. I was stopped by a strange knight coming around a thin ridge. He was dressed in white and red, and bore a black cross on his tunic. I tried to remember what Alta\u00efr had told me about different types of knights. A red and white outfit, a black cross... It was a knight Hospitlar! My mentor\"s words rang through my head as the knight told me to dismount: \"The Hospitlar are not well trained in battle, but be wary. If they see the Hashashin cloak, they will attack. Remember your combat pattern. The knight took one look at my outfit, and drew his sword. I did the same, and prepared to fight. I spoke my training out loud while performing the actions. \"Wait for their strike...\" The knight raised his sword for a downward strike. \"Parry inward...\" I redirected the strike, bringing the knight in closer. \"Pull up the helmet and...\" The blade strapped to my left wrist sprang open, and shot out into the opening at the knight\"s neck. I quickly pulled the helmet back down to block the torrent that followed my blade\"s withdrawal. As the knight crumpled, I remounted my horse, and rode towards the city gate as the sun rose. I fought back tears of sympathy for the knight; I could\"ve probably run, but I needed to get Rei back as soon as possible. I regained my composure as I passed through the gate and into the marketplace, where merchants were just setting up for the day. I dismounted, and walked around, looking for someone to get information from, but everyone seemed to ignore me. Just as I started to despair, a familiar voice called out: \"You sir! Come here! I have many things for sale! I\"ve many things! ... Too many things! I have too many things!\" It was the merchant I had come to before. I knew I wasn\"t supposed to make contact with anyone during a mission, but I needed information. I approached him, and removed my hood. He instantly recognized me, and called me over. \"It\"s you! I never thought I\"d see you again!\" \"Well, I thought the same...\" \"So, did you find your friend?\" \"I did, but I need your help.\" \"What can I do for you, sir?\" \"I need to know where King Richard is going to be parading today.\" \"He\"ll be over by the Acre Cathedral. ... Put your hood on, sir!\" \"What?\" \"The guards are going by, and if you\"re going to approach Richard close enough to make the kill, you\"ll need to be anonymous.\" \"You\"re...you\"re with us?\" \"Ten years so far, Intelligence Division.\" \"Wow. I\"m...sorry.\" \"Anyway, head for the tallest spire in the city, over that way. Wait outside the Cathedral, and make your move when the time is right. Good luck, sir.\" \"It\"s Shinji, brother.\" \"Brother... No agent has called me brother in years.\" I left the merchant, and headed through the city for Acre Cathedral. All around, signs announced Richard\"s arrival in the city. Getting to the cathedral grounds, I took a seat on the bench, and waited for the spectacle to begin, looking around and planning my escape. The crowd thickened as the time drew near. The king would exit the cathedral in a few minutes, and begin his parade over to the town gate. The King on his horse would be guarded in front and in back by a battalion of knights, but his sides would be vulnerable. I would be able to get within six feet before people took notice, but that was good enough. The crowd formed a line as the guards instructed, and the parade started. The first half of the king\"s guard came out of the church\"s gates, followed by the man himself. I began to make my way through the crowd, gently pushing people out of the way until I was at the front of the cheering mass. The King and his steed were just about to pass when someone came out of the crowd on the other side, approaching Richard. He wore a knight\"s uniform, and kneeled out of respect. Richard motioned, and the whole parade stopped instantly. The crowd fell silent, and the knight spoke up. \"My king, I bring urgent news from the battlefield.\" \"General, this is a peaceful visit on the behalf of religion, not military. How dare you interrupt!\" \"But, my liege, we are being defeated! We need this battalion of soldiers, or we will surely fail!\" \"Take him away.\" Two guards in front of the King\"s horse restrained the General, and took him aside. The Field Marshall at the front was just preparing the guard to march when I approached. Richard yelled as I left the crowd, heading for him. \"What now!? What business do you have with me?\" I did not stop, and broke into a fevered stride as the guard tried to move to protect him. I leapt into the air as Alta\u00efr had taught me, and extended the blade on my left wrist as I stabbed into his throat. The guard and the crowd fell totally silent and froze in place. Time seemed to slow down as I pulled out a feather and pulled it through the wound on his neck. No words came from him, but I felt the need to explain myself before the guards came to his aid. \"I\"m sorry.\" The guards soon shook themselves of the shock, and ran at me. I bolted back the way I had came, pushing through the crowd as fast as I could. Once out of the seething mass, I sprinted for a nearby building. Jumping onto a crate, then up to a balcony, then using mislaid bricks to climb onto the roof. The guards were slow to follow, most unable to even make the climb. I ran across the rooftop, and jumped over the narrow gaps between the city buildings. Running across the city roofs, I made it back to the main gate. Dropping down into a cart full of straw, I called out to my merchant friend. \"Hey! Hey! Brother! It\"s Shinji! Get over here!\" \"My friend! What are you doing in a cart of straw? Come out, you are safe with me!\" The undercover Hashashin agent brought me over to his stall, where he gave me a large cloak to cover my uniform. I slipped out of the gate, and took a horse from the merchant\"s stable. I rode at full gallop back to the fortress at Masyaf, where the other Assassins greeted him with great joy. Pushing past them, I made a beeline for the Master\"s library. Once inside, Alta\u00efr took me to see the Master. The Master was overjoyed to see the feather with Richard\"s blood, and Alta\u00efr came clean about his plan. \"Master, will you send this boy home now?\" \"Yes, I believe it is the least I can do.\" \"Then I have something to ask of you, Master.\" \"What is it Alta\u00efr? I suppose I owe you something for training the boy.\" \"I want to give him his woman back, and ask that you send them both home.\" \"Eh? You don\"t want her? Are you right in the head, Alta\u00efr?\" \"It was my plan from the start, Master. I wanted to keep her pure for when they returned.\" \"Very well. Bring her in!\" Rei was brought in by an escort, who let her go at the Master\"s command. Rei ran to my side, and hugged me tightly, burying her face in my cloak. \"It\"s alright, Rei. We\"re going home now.\" \"I know, I\"m just ... so sorry. I made you kill that person.\" \"It was worth it, Rei. Let\"s just go home. We\"re ready now, Master.\" \"You call no one master, Shinji. Now, just take a deep breath, hold your woman tight, and open this box.\" He placed a small box on his desk, and unlocked it. I said goodbye to Alta\u00efr, and held Rei close with my right hand. I opened the box, and the two of us looked down into it. A small silver vessel sat inside, which started to glow as we looked upon it. We suddenly felt pressure all around us, and we took a deep breath as the air liquefied and we felt ourselves being sucked through a small passage, much like the one we had entered through. My vision started to fade, but I held Rei close, and gave her a wink. She smiled at me as the passage sloped back up, and the water became colder. As my sight totally gave out, we only embraced tighter. After what seemed a few minutes, we surfaced. We were back in the river near Arch Island, and we broke our embrace to swim to shore. I reached the bank first, and turned around in time to see what I had thought of earlier. Rei, back in her tight t-shirt and jean-shorts, emerged from the water, dripping wet. She stood up, and ran into my waiting arms. She looked up at me, and smiled as fully as I had ever seen. I smiled back, and kissed her. Her deep red eyes looked into mine, water and tears of joy moistening them until she closed them, losing herself in the moment. After a minute or so, we parted to a welcome sight: Hikari sat on a rock nearby, pretending to avert her eyes. She saw we were done kissing, and walked over. \"Well, you guys ok?\" \"Yeah,\" I said. \"We\"re just fine.\" \"What happened?\" \"Rei got sucked under, and-\" I was going to continue, but Rei cut me off. \"Shinji followed me down through a tunnel in the river bottom. We came out on the other side in a different time period, but I was captured by the Assassins. Shinji arrived, but I was put into service in their harem. In order to save me, Shinji was trained for five week to be an Assassin, and killed King Richard I. We were then teleported back here by the Assassin\"s Master and his magical silver vessel.\" Hikari looked at Rei with raised eyebrows, then turned to me. I nodded, and smiled. \"Rei, I usually never hear you speak more than five words at a time; now that you do, you\"re telling some story about Assassins and harems? You really are a mystery, Rei.\" Rei merely smiled, and turned back to me. \"I believe you, Rei.\" \"And besides,\" Hikari continued, \"You said you were gone for five weeks. It\"s been about a minute since you dove down after Rei.\" \"Whatever, Hikari. Let\"s just go home, ok?\" \"That would be nice,\" Rei said, taking my arm and running over to the boat. \"You know what, Hikari,\" I said, turning to my old friend. \"You row yourself back. We\"ll swim.\" Rei and I jumped back into the cool waters, swimming across to the bank and sitting down on the sand. We watched Hikari row across, laughing at her novice rowing technique. I was glad to see Rei laughing for once; it was kind of a fetish of mine. \"You look like you\"ve got it, Hikari.\" She was almost halfway to the shore, and was getting the hang of rowing. \"We\"ll see you up at the house, ok?\" Hikari started to cry out to us, using some very strong words, but it was no use; we were long gone. Once back up on the porch, Rei and I finally felt safe. She looked at me, and some tears came. She laid her head on my chest, and repeated her apology. \"I\"m sorry, Shinji.\" \"At least now you know how much I love you, Rei.\" \"But do you know how much I love you?\" She placed another kiss on my lips, and I held her tight. We stayed like this until Hikari\"s shouts grew near. We broke our kiss for her, and she ran up to me, winding up for a huge smack aimed at my face. Out of instinct, and as Alta\u00efr had taught me, I reached out and grabbed her arm as it swung, and put my left hand under her neck, only to realize that I no longer possessed my blade. \"Umm...Shinji?\" \"Yes, Hikari?\" \"Stop being so weird and let me smack you!\" \"Why?\" \"Why!? Never mind. I\"m going back home; I\"ll see you tomorrow?\" \"Maybe...\" \"Ok, then. Goodbye, Rei. Oh, and Shinji: remember what I told you before you two went in the river!\" \"Right.\" Hikari walked down the gravel path to the street, while Rei and I sat on the porch, drying off in the day\"s last sunlight. \"Shinji, why did you do it?\" \"Kill King Richard?\" \"Yes.\" \"They told me that whatever happened had already happened before I went back, so figured it was what I was supposed to do. Plus, I couldn\"t let you be some harem girl; you deserve more than just being someone\"s plaything. No one should have to go through that.\" \"Thank you.\" \"You didn\"t have to do that, did you?\" \"No. I told the other girls my story, and they promised to keep me safe from the initiates.\" \"What a relief.\" \"I was also relieved to see you turn down the other girls\" advances in the garden.\" \"I did? I don\"t remember much.\" \"They tried to remove their clothes, but you pinned them back up; then you covered your lap and said \"no\" over and over until you passed out. Then the guards took you away.\" \"How about that...\" The sun went down, and we stood at the railing of the porch, watching the sun dip below the horizon. It was beautiful; it was as if the sun had saved up all its energy for one last show before night took over. The amber light reflected in Rei\"s crimson eyes as she stared off into the distance, then to me. I remembered what Hikari had told me before our ordeal, and decided this was the time. I took her hand, and asked her: \"Rei, would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow?\" \"Yes, that would be nice.\" She leaned in and gave me one last kiss before going back home, short but intense. She then said goodbye and turned, walking down the steps to the gravel path leading to the street. I stopped her before she could leave, though. \"Rei, wait! One more thing. What was staying with Alta\u00efr like?\" \"It was ... pleasant, but not like being with you. I will see you tomorrow?\" \"Yes, Rei. That\"s a promise.\" She smiled and turned away, walking up the path back to the street, by which she would no doubt return to the city. I thought to myself as I walked back inside: \"At least now Hikari can\"t say Rei needs to get out more.\"", "Seekers roared over his head, but they and the Sweeps with them began a running fight with Hound and Seaspray. One Sweep was then shot down from above. It was Blitzwing, arriving on the field. Onslaught wondered why the Metroplex station was still under power. He knew that was the only reason Razorclaw had not formed Predaking. \"Vortex! Blast Off! Find out where Metroplex is getting power,\" ordered Onslaught. The Combaticon duo flew off in different directions. Onslaught held Brawl and Swindle back for the moment. The Seacons were accompanying the Constructicons, Galvatron, Reflector, and Soundwave. They were gingerly getting Trypticon closer to the battlefield. Vortex hovered over the southern edge looking for strange stuff on the ground. He dodged a shot from Warpath. The Autobots had thinned their complement in Metroplex. Rewind and Eject were now at the controls. What was Warpath doing in this spot? Vortex spied a snake on the ground. He zoomed in on it. Sure enough it was a pipeline leading to the south. If that was the case, then the Autobots certainly weren\"t defending the whole length of pipe. \"Vortex to Onslaught, the Autobots are using some kind of pipe to bring power to Metroplex from the south,\" said Vortex. \"Good work, Vortex. I\"m sending Swindle to you. You two will blow the south pipe. Blast Off, Brawl, and I will target the shorter one to the north. Good luck,\" answered Onslaught. Swindle and some explosives would make short work of that pipe, thought Vortex. Vortex went further south, not noticing that Blaster had figured him out from his place at Metroplex. DECECPTICON CAMP- AUTOBOT CITY Rumble looked at his other guards. There was Frenzy, Slugfest, and Overkill. Not exactly murderer\"s row. Galvatron had cleared out as Trypticon was now under way. It was only the tapes. Rumble wondered about the slaughter he was missing. Then he thought he heard a dull roar of engines. No reason for Ramjet to come back here, he thought. Then he heard a crash. Two seconds later he felt a chain around his waist and found himself tossed into a collapsed wall. Frenzy tried to respond, but he found himself under the influence of insufferable music. He tried to cover ears, but when he had done so, he found himself shot for his trouble. The noise also did holy terror to the sensitive instruments of Overkill and Slugfest. They did not need to be shot, they shorted out. The four tapes had been overcome. Jazz emerged from his firefight. That had been too easy. There were complaints to be found for the Autobot. He looked around and found where the other Autobots were being held. \"Jazz! Am I glad to see you!\" said Goldbug, straining in energy bonds. \"Get us out of here!\" \"One second, little buddy,\" muttered Jazz as he looked for something to break the bonds. After a minute he gave up and shot Goldbug\"s bounds where the hinge was. Around Goldbug were the remaining Technobots. Soon they were free too. \"What\"s the situation, sir?\" asked Scattershot, now ready for action. \"Don\"t know for sure. Metroplex is being attacked east of here,\" answered Jazz. \"Probabilities suggest that he managed to get as far as the dams around the Catawba River, but not to Fortress Bragg,\" answered Scattershot. \"I can get there quickly, and so can the Aerialbots and Powerglide but the rest of you...\" \"You will have to. Our main men need backup pronto,\" said Jazz. Goldbug had gone off to free the others. He now had Pipes, Outback, Powerglide, Hot Spot, Streetwise, First Aid, Groove, Fireflight, Slingshot, and Skydive with him. \"Right, Scattershot will take the flyers to the battlefield. The rest will follow the best we can,\" said Jazz. \"What about your ship?\" asked Goldbug. \"No dice. She did not like the last landing,\" responded Jazz. The Autobots transformed and took off. METROPLEX- SOUTH OF MAIN BATTLE Swindle planted the charges. Warpath had tried to stop the Combaticon duo, but they were too shifty. Steeljaw and Ramhorn arrived just in time to witness the southern pipeline blow up. Swindle and Vortex withdrew to regroup with Onslaught. METROPLEX- NORTH SIDE OF BATTLE Onslaught was annoyed. Blitzwing had decided to stop them in tank mode from reaching the northern pipeline, which had a more direct connection to Metroplex. Onslaught decided to let Brawl duel with the traitor. He was going to send Blast Off over the top to blow the pipe further up the river. Then they would eliminate their former comrade. Blast Off found himself past Blitzwing easily, but found he was still under fire. Sideswipe had used his backpack to show up and intervene. The Autobot was relentless. Blast Off complained to Onslaught. \"I still have an Autobot here, can I get some backup?\" asked Blast Off, trying to outpace Sideswipe. \"One minute,\" grumbled Onslaught. He tracked a path to where he could get a clear shot. Then he transformed and fired his back guns at Sideswipe, catching the Autobot unawares and causing him to tumble into the forest. Blast Off now descended and laid explosives on the pipeline. With it ruptured, Metroplex was now on his own power. Fire ceased for a moment on the Predacons. Predaking now formed and moved to where Supatron and Menasor were locked in combat. The Combaticons forced Blitzwing to retreat toward the station and moved to find Swindle and Vortex. They too planned to be heard from. Supatron was in a tugging match with Menasor, but noticed the oncoming Predaking. Before the Predacon giant could lay on a major blow with his sword, Supatron split into his components. Predaking responded by knocking Silverbolt and Air Raid out of the sky and they landed in a heap next to Nosecone. Predaking raised his gun, as Menasor prepared to knock down Strafe and Blades. Nosecone looked at his two companions and waited for the shot. He heard it fire and then... Nothing. Nosecone could still hear the sounds of combat. Predaking\"s gun had been forced away by something like a large artillery blast. He looked to see what had happened to Strafe and instead found a very crowded sky. There was another blast from above. It was Scattershot. He landed next to Nosecone and transformed. \"You know what we have to do,\" said Scattershot. Nosecone was not certain who he was talking to. The situation was clear enough. Yet he saw Silverbolt and Air Raid nod and return to the sky. There they joined up with the others to form Superion. The brief career of Supatron was over. \"Distract Predaking,\" answered Nosecone. \"That\"s right. Jazz is on his way, but it is going to take some time. Lightspeed and Afterburner are with him,\" said Scattershot. \"You\"re right. Metroplex can\"t use any more power unless there\"s an emergency,\" said Hound arriving with Seaspray and Blitzwing. \"When exactly do we decide it\"s an emergency?\" asked Blades, dropping down in robot mode. \"Oh I think we\"ll get there pretty quickly,\" said Hound. \"The Combaticons are here somewhere. Add Bruticus to this mess and its lights out for us.\" \"Then we must split up the Combaticons. Strafe, Blitzwing, Powerglide, Blades, and I will put the drop on the Combaticons,\" said Scattershot. \"I guess that means Nosecone, Seaspray, and I will distract Predaking. No easy feat,\" answered Hound. Predaking turned on Superion, but then he was distracted by something...Defensor! Predaking changed direction to deal with the Combiner, leaving Menasor and Superion to play out their rivalry on this section of the battlefield. Scattershot\"s group found the friendly skies less friendly with Thrust and Ramjet amongst them. After a few passes, Blades transformed to robot mode and signaled to Scattershot to leave him. Time was of the essence as the moment that Scattershot feared was almost upon them. Blades took his gun and shot down Ramjet\"s rudder, forcing the Decepticon down. Now he landed to take on Ramjet. Thrust landed too. They fired their null rays at Blades, which he deftly avoided before flipping into the air and pulling out his swords. He landed and then swiped at the legs of Thrust, while thrusting the other sword in Ramjet\"s knee. Ramjet, now twice wounded, buckled down in pain. Thrust retreated. Blades did not have time to finish Ramjet, he went airborne again, only to find himself the target of the Sweeps. He now tried to run for it in heliocopter mode toward Metroplex. Warpath, not too far away was desperately trying to slow down Swindle. He had seen the reflection of Onslaught\"s windshield from farther away and he knew that Bruticus was not good. Blast Off arrived and began trying to drive Warpath off. It was then Blast Off\"s turn to seek cover as the flying Autobots with Scattershot opened fire on him and Vortex. Vortex nodded at Blast Off and the two grabbed Swindle suddenly and flew toward Brawl and Onslaught. Scattershot and Powerglide tried to keep up. Strafe fired wildly. Yet there was no chance, as the Combaticons came together and formed Bruticus. \"Bruticus crush Autobots!\" yelled the Combiner. \"Warpath to Blaster. We are out of BLAM options. Bruticus just formed here in the South ZAP. We have no answer for him or Predaking. We have to get what we can out of the \"Plex,\" radioed Warpath. \"Ok, if that is what you say. I\"ll fire the bad boy up again, but you know what this means...\" responded Blaster. \"POW! I know, I know,\" answered Warpath. Noises began to quake near the battlefield. Blaster jumped away from fortress Metroplex. Fighting ceased for the moment as the fortress slowly transformed into the massive city bot that was its true strength. Metroplex lurched up and forward, drawing a gun. \"Metroplex heeds the call of the cassette player,\" answered Metroplex. Now upright, he viewed the battlefield. He raised his gun and fired it at Predaking, catching the Predacon combiner in surprise as he had just turned away from \"Defensor.' The blast took Rampage clear off. The second blast broke the Combiner all together. Hound relaxed, but wondered how much power Metroplex had left. Bruticus shot down Powerglide and Blitzwing, and now saw the rising Metroplex. Even one such as he would not be able to battle that Autobot monster. He also found himself as Metroplex\"s next target. He executed a barrel roll that sent Scattershot and Strafe scrambling and avoided the blast from Metroplex. Metroplex then released a storm of missiles. Bruticus found safety by dodging, but Menasor, still locked with Superion, could not get out of the way. The Stunticon giant found himself in pieces. With Predacons and Stunticons looking for way out, the battlefield had shifted. The Autobots now only had Bruticus to deal with. Metroplex raised his gun once more and aimed it at the Combaticon combiner. Then he felt a pin prick from somewhere. His eyes found Galvatron in missile launcher form. With Galvatron was Abominus and an unrecognizable form for most Autobots, Piranacon. As the Stunticons retreated, Tentakil changed from being an arm as Piranacon grabbed Drag Strip and placed him in Tentakil\"s socket. Tentakil now became a weapon, and Piranacon\"s shots forced Metroplex to shield his face. Galvatron motioned for Trypticon to emerge and engage Metroplex. A repaired Devastator also was on the field. Metroplex had little answer for the combined power of Trypticon and Piranacon as they blasted away at him. Superion engaged Abominus. Galvatron and Soundwave left their perch on Trypticon and watched the fight. Bruticus now added his firepower. Metroplex was weakening. Bruticus suddenly found a grapple on his neck. He found a punch to his optic lens. It did not shatter it, but it was annoying. The source was Jazz, and as Bruticus looked down, he could see many Autobots. He saw Hot Spot and Groove. That meant...but Bruticus was too late. As Jazz withdrew, he found Defensor right in front of him. He would have found Computron too, but the Technobot combiner had gone off to target Piranacon. Jazz and Goldbug regrouped with the other Autobots. There were a good number of them now, and with Warpath, Hound, Seaspray, and others from the original group they could make life very difficult for Galvatron. However they found themselves in a firefight with the various combiner pieces from Predaking and Menasor. If Metroplex could defeat Trypticon, they could still win. Metroplex and Trypticon began manuvering at each other, eventually becoming locked in a rather large wrestling match. Metroplex searched for a hold on the dinosaur and could not find one that he liked. Finally he went low, hoping that Trypticon would try to jump out of the way. Trypticon did jump and Metroplex caught him on his sides near his chest. Now Metroplex intended to hurl him into the ocean, though the ocean was two hundred miles away. He raised him above his head and threw him... about two feet. At that moment Metroplex fell on one knee. He could feel the energy draining out of him. Trypticon and the Decepticons began firing on Metroplex with all they had. Trypticon now turned on the Autobot combiners. He shot down Superion and dispersed the Aerialbots. He knocked over Computron with his tail and then broke him up with his mouth cannon. Defensor began to withdraw, knowing he was next. Bruticus took the opportunity to attack the various Autobots on the field. He downed Pipes and Outback. Jazz and Goldbug transformed to avoid him. Sixshot appeared, and he began hunting the survivors of the Combiners. He left three Aerialbots disabled. Most of his firepower was reserved for Metroplex. The sixchanger wanted nothing less than to be the one who took the final shot. Hound, Seaspray, Warpath, Jazz, Goldbug, and Defensor began to gather to each other for one final stand. Neither Autobot or Decepticon noticed a white dot on the horizon. As Sky Lynx flew closer, Optimus opened a door to the air outside. \"Dinobots, destroy Devastator!\" Grimlock responded, \"Me Grimlock love d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!\" The five Dinobots leaped from the moving shuttle. This time they caught Devastator by surprise. Galvatron angrily noted their appearance and tried to pinpoint where they had come from. On Sky Lynx, Optimus Prime and Getaway were the only remaining passengers. The shuttle landed and the two exited. Optimus Prime looked over the battle and muttered, more to himself than anyone else, Trypticon must be stopped, no matter the cost. Rev and Chip were already in their positions. Optimus transformed into truck mode with the lunar station trailer coming behind. Getaway tailed from a safe distance. The first Decepticon that Optimus found was Sixshot, who was oblivious to him, and got clocked out of the way. Thrust too could not move fast enough. Divebomb managed to jump out of the way, but then Optimus transformed out of his trailer AND his TRAILER TRANSFORMED WITH HIM. Optimus now became the centerpiece of Powermaster Optimus Prime. With the big massive black guns, Optimus knocked the arms off of Bruticus. Piranacon tried to use his Targetmaster abilities, but Optimus had too much armor. Optimus took down Piranacon with his second black rifle, damaging the Overbite and Skalor legs. Meanwhile Getaway rallied the Autobots. Defensor advanced on Piranacon, while Getaway led the charge on the Stunticons and Predacons. The Dinobots finished Devastator and began to move on to Bruticus. Galvatron raged as Optimus Prime was now engaged with Trypticon itself. He could not believe the great size that Optimus had obtained. He also could not believe that Onslaught had told him that no Autobots would come from the moon. Sky Lynx pounced on Razorclaw and Soundwave. Powermaster Optimus was not quite as big as Defensor or Bruticus, but his firepower was formidable. He was also much quicker than Trypticon. His shoulder cannons could bombard the Decepticon with shot and shell and then he could dodge any retaliation. Galvatron watched as his army began to wither. Trypticon was taking a pounding. Trypticon was his only way off this battlefield and planet. Galvatron knew what he had to do. \"Decepticons! Retreat to Trypticon! Trypticon, transform to spaceship mode! Astrotrain! Cover the retreat! You may have won this time, Prime, but I shall have my revenge!\" yelled Galvatron. Some Decepticons had to be carried to Trypticon, but they all made it. Optimus let them go. There was still work to be done. Optimus Prime disconnected from the trailer body and met his Autobots as they rushed to meet him. They had mixed emotions. Before they could speak, Prime motioned to the Protectobots. \"Organize the wounded, First Aid. The rest of you help out. Warpath, reconnect Metroplex to the power relays. When he has enough power, move him back to Autobot City. Hound and Seaspray help him. Sky Lynx, prepare for flight. Jazz, Goldbug, the Dinobots, and I have a trip to Nebulos to make.\" Getaway motioned, \"What about me, Prime? What should I do?\" \"You\"ve done enough, old friend. Though once the Technobots are up to it, you can help them fix the Turbo Racer,\" said Optimus. \"I imagine Wheeljack would be glad to see it in one piece again.\" \"What about Galvatron, Prime?\" asked Goldbug. \"I think Galvatron will take some time to reflect and repair before he strikes again. And again you men showed him why he should just give up the business of evil. Our battle today is not over, but for this moment, you have made me proud to serve the way of justice,\" said Optimus Prime. NEBULOS Within Scorponok, Zarak was steaming. His time away from Nebulos had degraded his control over the hive machines. Many of them were controlled by the Nebulan villages from stations designed from Fortress Maximus. The result had been an endless stalemate. Headmasters and Targetmasters everywhere. It was so frustrating. If only the Hive had not built their cities so well! Then Fortress Maximus would have been a pushover. The other side was no less fatigued. Constant fighting was draining on them too. Kup shook his head as he and Hot Rod dodged fire from above. \"Reminds me of the time on Bega Four, when our ship crashed and we were surrounded by Raticulae for three weeks,\" said the veteran. \"How\"d you beat them?\" asked Hot Rod. \"Well, the Raticulae seemed to have a matriarchal hierarchy, so we split of the Queen from the rest of the pack and they were lost after that,\" answered Kup. \"Hmm. Do you think we can corner Scorponok away from the other Decepticons?\" asked Hot Rod. \"Yes, but why would you want to?\" asked Kup. \"I\"ve got a feeling,\" answered Hot Rod. He then explained his plan to Kup. Cyclonus noticed a white blurr in the sky. Scourge also noted it, \"Sky Lynx. It could be Galvatron has failed.\" \"Yes, Scourge, but remember there\"s a second part to our mission. The Autobots might yet prove useful to us,\" answered Cyclonus. Sky Lynx landed in the Autobot lines. For the first time Hot Rod and Kup got to meet Powermaster Prime. The two looked at each other and laughed. Not at Prime, but at how easy their plan was going to be with the addition of the new big guy, Jazz, Goldbug, the Dinobots, and Sky Lynx. They told Optimus what they wanted to do and then Prime organized his forces. Apeface and Snapdragon noted that they were cut off from Scorponok by fire from two directions. Jazz and Goldbug provided part of it, and Chromedome provided the rest. Cyclonus and Scourge tried to support them from the air only to become targets for Brainstorm and Highbrow in vehicle mode. With Scorponok cleaved off from the group, Fortress Maximus, Powermaster Optimus Prime, the Dinobots, and Sky Lynx concentrated their power on the massive scorpion robot. Zarak could not believe it. Galvatron had failed on Earth, clearly. Now there was too much firepower, firepower than he did not know the Autobots even possessed. He could not stay here. Cyclonus flew through the hail of fire to the head of Scorponok. \"I think it is right to withdraw now.\" Zarak flinched under the fire and asked, \"Where would we go?\" Cyclonus responded, \"To Charr.\" Zarak nodded. \"Withdraw men, withdraw.\" Scorponok turned into spaceship mode and the various Decepticons climbed on board. \"And that takes care of that,\" said Kup. \"I\"m not sure. We hit Scorponok pretty hard, but the others weren\"t bad off. Something else is going on. Sky Lynx, take me, Jazz, Goldbug, and the Dinobots to Cybertron. We will monitor things from there,\" said Optimus. CHARR Scorponok tried to land but found himself under fire from the start. The Decepticon targetmasters abandoned their weapons and bailed out. The Headmasters were not so lucky, as they had to leave their heads behind. Zarak roared through the head of Scorponok. Treachery! Scorponok was getting hit from all directions, but the worst hits were coming from a giant lizard like thing that Zarak had never seen before. It was of course Trypticon. Zarak and his Hive brethren found Scorponok too damaged to fight back. They could only run. Where would they go? Who could know? Galvatron smiled. His conquest may have been delayed, but the Hive were removed from his troubles. The Constructicons went out to gather up the Headmaster beasts. They would all need new heads. The Targetmasters would need their old weapons back. The Decepticons were whole once again, free of Hive influence."]}
{"id": "db99a4c5-e5e0-59be-912c-27b1d6f637cb", "fandoms": ["Fire Emblem", "Legend of Zelda"], "pair": ["\"Naesala.' There was no denying the disappointment etched into her brother\"s face-straight-mouthed and wary-eyed. \"I don\"t understand,' Leanne dared to speak out of the bounds set up by Reyson\"s questions, \"Why do you look worried, brother? Naesala has always been kind to us. I was the one who wanted to get out of this castle; he only accompanied me, and saw me back here safely.' Reyson stood up from his seat and turned away from Leanne, resting his hands on the table\"s surface, \"I know that... just as well as you know that he has done a few questionable things in recent times.' Working against the laguz, stealing, handing Reyson over to Oliver... Leanne had heard the tales, but she had seen more than that: he had saved her when she was captured and he had fought on the righteous side in the final battle, and those events were far more recent than the negative ones that everyone seemed to use as warnings time and again. \"I\"m not going to stop you. The best I could do without letting Tibarn in on this would be to either watch you myself or have Nealuchi guard you at all times, and you would undoubtedly do all in your power to escape me, and Nealuchi would cave under yours and Naesala\"s pleads within seconds.' Her face beaming, Leanne clasped her hands and brought them to her chin, giddy with thoughts of the freedom that she could get to bask in, even if fleeting. The older of the siblings walked to the opposite side of the table, and his sister stood up to greet him. He tossed his arms around her and she did her best to return the gesture, her hug limited to use of her forearms because of Reyson\"s hold. \"Just don\"t be... irrational,' he warned with carefully thought-out words, earning a disgruntled sigh from Leanne, \"Seriously, Leanne.' As best as she could manage, Leanne tightened her hug as reassurance, \"Don\"t worry, brother. I\"ll be careful.' Squirming out of Reyson\"s grasp, she looked to him with a smile and added, \"And Naesala will be there to protect me!' With that said, she gave him another hurried hug and headed to the dining room\"s exit before the conversation could be dragged out any longer. Once she was out of sight, Reyson took in as much breath as he could and sighed it out slowly, until all of the air was out of his lungs. \"She didn\"t understand my point at all...\" he mused aloud with exasperation. His eyed turned to the table, left littered with the dishes that Nealuchi had not brought along with him as he left, and he let out a groan filled with as much vexation as his last spoken words. The topic seemed to dissipate after that conversation, only being reared on occasion when Leanne caught her brother giving her that same, solemn look; however, he usually caught himself and turned away quickly with a sigh. Each day Leanne chose to spend many of the daylight hours in her room, looking out of her window while overlooking Reyson\"s apparent concern. It was a day less than a week since Naesala\"s first visit when the raven\"s flapping wings sounded outside of Leanne\"s window again. The heron princess was seated on her bed, propped against the backboard with a book written in modern script in her hands. She squinted at the words in front of her and twisted her lips from side to side with vain hope that they would spontaneously be neatly translated into the language that she understood. If she heard them she could understand them, but looking at them was another story altogether... After deciding that she grasped enough of the words in front of her, Leanne moved to flip to the following two pages; as her fingers rested on the paper\"s corner, however, the sound of a light tapping at her window met her ears before the sound of a page being turned. Her head snapped to the window and her eyes widened with renewed attentiveness when she saw Naesala hovering outside, his knuckles pressed against the glass having rested there after knocking. Finally having the heron\"s attention, the hand against the window motioned through a series of actions: a wave hello, a thumb pointing behind him, outside, and a finger pressed to his lips to encourage silence. With that, he sank down and out of the view seen from Leanne\"s window. Not sparing a second, she closed the book and left her bookmark atop her bed where it would not get to serve its purpose. She hurriedly shifted off of the bed and examined the room; with a deep inhale, she hoped that if anyone happened to drop by her room, it was Reyson. There was no way that Tibarn would let her excuse pass without questioning again, but there was also no way to conceal her absence while she was with Naesala. In spite of the risks, Leanne left the room behind her as she unlocked her literal window to the outside world. Spotting Naesala waiting below by the side of the castle, she soared down and lowered her feet to the ground next to him. She looked up at him hopefully, and was slightly taken aback to find his eyes looking down as gravely as her brother\"s had been doing all week. As she opened her mouth to question it, Naesala spoke up in a tone that she was not expecting: provoking, teasing, he spoke exactly as he did when he wore a smirk and playful eyes, \"You took so long getting down here. Do you not want to go exploring today?\" \"I-I do!\" Leanne said frantically, \"Take me, ah, away! To... explore.\" Heaving a melodramatic sigh, Naesala caved into her pleading as though it were a chore, \"Fine then. But today we go to an area that a raven like me is more adjusted to.\" Without any hesitation, Leanne gave an eager nod, and then as an afterthought asked the question that she should have considered beforehand, \"...Where?\" Instead of voicing an answer, he expanded his wings and lifted himself higher and higher in the air until Leanne had no choice but to follow. It was somewhat of a relief that their flight was much more leisurely than the last one that they had taken together, although Leanne could think of many worse things than having to be carried by Naesala again... like Tibarn\"s fury if he ever found out she had snuck out, or the stench of Nealuchi\"s breath after he ate one of his questionable meals, or Janaff provoking Ulki into an entertaining squabble, or a brotherly embrace from Reyson... The examples strolling through her mind were growing less and less negative, and yet somehow they all seemed appropriately worse than having Naesala lift her up and go for a flight. Naesala gave a sidelong glance to his company and could hardly begin to imagine what had her so diverted from her surroundings. Surely she should have noticed and commented on the highest peak of Phoenicis growing larger and larger in front of them as Naesala directed their flight in that direction. When the mountain was close enough to land on, Naesala finally piped up with a gaze directed completely at Leanne, \"Hey, fancy that! Look at where we are!\" The heron\"s wings halted for an instant, and then she shook her head and glanced downwards while Naesala added to his previous statement, \"It\"s the best part of Phoenicis, in my modest opinion.\" As he comfortably landed on the rocky surface, colourless everywhere and jagged in many places, Leanne resisted following suit. \"It is, um...\" she hesitated; for the first time, her hesitation was not the result of being unable to think of a specific word, but of struggling to find anything to say in any language at all, \"...grey.\" \"Tsk,\" Naesala clicked his tongue in protest, reaching out to Leanne and tugging on her sleeve until she complied and rested her feet on the surface next to him, \"You make that sound like the most terrible thing in the world!\" The twitch at the corner of Leanne\"s mouth that shifted her expression from straight-lipped to frown persisted until Naesala said something to redeem himself. As far as her consideration went, he had made a miscalculated decision in bringing her to the dreary cliffs for her outing; he knew that she enjoyed the rich, vivid colours of the forests... jade leaves, olive grass, azure skies, pastels of flowers-not the greyscale scenery of her current location. \"Come,\" Naesala urged, furthering his insistence by slipping his hand into hers and walking to the mountain\"s edge, \"look over here.\" Obeying with a scowl, Leanne shifted her attention to the view that Naesala was so persistent about showing her; within an instant, she understood why that was. The entire island of Phoenicis stretched out below her, mixed with colours beyond those that she adored in the woods. The greens, blues, and pales rainbows were all there, as were sunshine-tinted clouds, bright red and purple bushes overtaken by berries, villages of a myriad of colours... While Leanne continued to ogle the scenery, her raven company roamed over to a relatively round rock that jutted out from the ground to about the height of his knees. He claimed it as his perch, sitting atop it and staring at Leanne while she failed to notice his movement, or simply did not care. \"Why don\"t you come and sit here?\" he said, prying her attention away from nature. She turned around to find Naesala sitting on his boulder, patting the space left next to him to further emphasize his suggestion. Having no reason not to comply since she the view could still be enjoyed from where Naesala waited, Leanne wandered over and dithered before sitting down. She stared condescendingly at the rock, and then to the lower half of her dress, \"Ah,\" she motioned to the stone layered with loose dust and then to her impeccably white dress, \"It will be getting dirty.\" \"Hmm, that is a problem,\" Naesala brought a finger to his chin in contemplation, and then smoothly slid his arms about her waist and drew her closer to guide her to his lap, \"Sit on me, then.\" Leanne initially gripped onto his shoulders as an instinctive resistance, but after a moment\"s thought she decided that she had no reason not to go along with his offer, so she accepted his lap as a seat, his hands still at her waist and hers locked securely at the back of his neck. As her body settled into the position-her limbs loosening, heartbeat easing-she lowered her head onto his shoulder to observe the setting once again, albeit at a more peculiar angle. \"Am I comfortable?\" the raven king asked audaciously. Without paying any mind to the implications behind his question, Leanne responded, blushing nonetheless, \"V... Very comfy.\" A smirk overtook Naesala\"s face, enjoying the timidity of her answer without even having to see the blush accompanying it. When she had incited a reaction from him the last time that they were together, he had gotten flustered and slipped away; with the situation reversed, he did not feel that need to hold back. As Leanne lifted her head and gave him an adamant stare caught between a glare and a look of confusion, his certainty faltered because her thoughts must have been flashbacking in the same manner that his were. He turned his gaze away as she continued her meddling with words: \"Last time, why did you...\" she paused, and unable to find the word, placed her palm on Naesala\"s chest and pressed against it, \"...push? Push,\" she concluded with a nod, \"Why did you push me away?\" Naesala kept his eyes away from Leanne as he answered, \"We were in Tibarn\"s castle. Would it really have been intelligent of me to have not pushed you away?\" Leanne\"s eyes answered for her, prying and prying while Naesala continued to do his best to avoid looking at her as though expecting her stare to be one that would be difficult to ignore. Leanne\"s patience yielded before his evasion did, so she glided off of his lap, his hold on her casually breaking and leaving his hands lingering in the air. \"Leanne.\" \"Then, we go,\" she walked closer to the cliff\"s ledge, \"to Tibarn\"s castle. Nothing different there, here.\" Her wings outstretched and pulsed slightly as she hinted that she would take flight. Giving into her wordless threat, Naesala stood up and rushed up behind her, nonchalantly placing his hands at the tops of her wings and folding them back into a settled position. Leanne twirled around, her nose brushing against Naesala\"s and causing her to take a step back with a gasp that diminished the cold attitude that she had seemingly put up. As her heel fell over the summit\"s edge, Naesala reached over the small distance between them and drew her back onto solid ground. \"I don\"t doubt your ability to fly back up here if you fell off,\" he began, pulling her even further from the drop, or closer to himself, \"but how could I begin to redeem myself if I passed up on an opportunity to rescue a princess?\" She moved to turn her head away and conceal the smile relentlessly pulling at her lips, but Naesala swooped in and took it upon himself to smother the smile with a kiss. It felt to Leanne as though her insides were switching places, the juddering sensations in her stomach strong enough to spread through her whole upper body. Just as everything else settled down and her lips could finally absorb the feeling of his, hardly ideal in texture but flawless in nature, he pulled away. \"Back to the castle, then?\" Naesala did as Leanne had originally been threatening, spreading his wings and beating them without actually lifting himself from solid ground. He saw that any objections that she had had to his reluctance had dissolved; she seemed dumbfounded without anything to pester him about. \"Come on, Leanne,\" his voice crooned. The heron blinked, prolonging the time with her eyes closed before opening them again and nodding, \"Y-Yes. Yes.\" Their goodbyes were said at the back of the castle where no guards were patrolling. Leanne attempted to have him guide her to her room as he did the last time, but Naesala refused with the argument that the more times she disappears without a word, the more likely that there will be hawks waiting for her return. She perceived it as nothing but an excuse, although it still held logic that she could not deny; still, she hesitated before flying up to her window, and he showed no immediate desire to leave. When no actions or words came forth in spite of their unwillingness to part, Naesala spoke his farewell. \"Let\"s do this again, shall we? In six days, we\"ll say.\" The same amount of time that had passed since his last visit. Although she agreed with a nod, she wondered why he made it such a length of time: maybe he wanted to avoid suspicions with an obvious routine, or perhaps it had something to do with his responsibilities in Kilvas. In any case, Leanne had no complaints because six days instead of a week meant one less day that she would go without Naesala\"s company, and although he would never admit it, that was his reason as well. Awww, ha ha. I personally enjoyed writing the beginning of this chapter because sibling relationships are a blast to write, even though I don\"t do them often. As always, I\"m looking forward to hearing what you thought of this chapter! I am so sorry for taking such a long time to update, everyone! Here\"s where I insert the generic excuses like school and sickness more school and an anime convention (alright, not so generic). I won\"t make you wait anymore, though. Read away! The hawks were sparring. Leanne set her elbows onto the short wall that lined the castle\"s roof and squished her chest against it to get a closer look at the action below. It was almost disappointing that the one day that something interesting was happening was six days after Naesala\"s previous visit... almost being the only significant word in her mind because the alternative of spending time with Naesala seemed boundlessly superior. Still, watching the hawks was an entertaining way to pass the time while she waited for Naesala\"s arrival. Ulki and Janaff were both in their transformed states, testing out the strength of younger hawks that did not have the experience of true battles as they did. Tibarn was taking part in the training, as well, although he was practicing untransformed combat. Even from her post much higher up, Leanne could make out the contours of the hawk king\"s exposed abs in fair detail. She leaned in slightly closer, a subconscious grin on her lips as she felt liquid giddiness swirl in her stomach; the feeling as she watched Tibarn brawl with his upper half unclothed felt so similar to the feeling when Naesala had kissed her. Bringing that experience to mind, Leanne\"s thoughts began to drift to how she would greet Naesala when he arrived. She knew that she wanted another one of those kisses-maybe a few more, even-but she was not sure that she could simply move in and initiate one herself. She considered coaxing him into giving her the first one, and then perhaps she could approach him for more as she saw fit. What if he did not understand what she wanted, though? Throughout her entire life she had heard girls complaining about how boys never processed hints. Still contemplating a resolution to her dilemma, Leanne felt arms wrap around her from behind and a face nuzzle into the base of her wings. Calm despite what should have been startling, Leanne turned her head as far left as she could and moved her gaze the same direction. She caught a glimpse of black feathers that confirmed that she was being embraced by whom she assumed, so she returned her eyes to the scene below, looking past it instead of at it, wrapped up in Naesala\"s arms and nothing else. The hug tightened briefly and then loosened considerably, allowing Leanne to turn around and face him at last. Before their eyes could even catch each other, Naesala nonchalantly made their lips connect. ...That certainly solved Leanne\"s problem. Pulling away, the raven king murmured lowly, \"Hello.\" Leanne breathed out a sigh appeased by his action and the questions that had been lifted along with it. \"Hi Naesala.\" He propped his chin on the top of her head to better see the happenings below. \"I guess we\"d best get out of here,\" he remarked, and Leanne could feel his throat vibrate, which made her giggle. \"I\"m already sick of so much of our time being spent travelling... It can\"t be helped, though, can it?\" Identifying the question as one that was not meant to be answered, Leanne remained silent until Naesala pulled back again and posed another question, this one not rhetorical: \"I\"d say it\"s worth it, though, wouldn\"t you?\" Squinting her eyes with a smile, Leanne gave a resolute nod. \"Yes!\" \"Then let\"s go,\" he said, already beginning to walk to the opposite side of the roof where the hawks\" eyes could not see him. Leanne turned to follow, but before actually moving forward she glanced back at the hawks, satisfaction on her face as she noted them all-especially the attentive Ulki and Janaff-just as engaged as ever, oblivious to her escape. Eagerness in her movements, she had a subtle skip in her step as she followed Naesala. Once they were in the sky, Naesala instantly took it upon himself to lead the way to the location that he had decided on. Leanne opened her mouth to protest his guidance, remembering the disappointment that she had felt last time; however, when she recalled how happy she had been when they left, she switched her conversation to life at Phoenicis. She chattered on in the ancient tongue for most of the flight. Much of her babbling was amusing to Naesala, most of it being gossip that she had heard around the hawk palace and was then repeating without any reservations. Part of him was interested in memorizing the rumours for any potential uses they could have in the future, but above all, he was charmed by how she rambled everyone\"s secrets off without a care or regret. He was certain that the subjects of her gossip would hardly be as delighted at her free spirit, but that only made it more captivating to him. The blatant contrast between her innocent heron appearance and some of the raven-like suggestions coming from her mouth were deliciously unbalanced. \"Where we go?\" she suddenly asked, changing to the modern language as though ensuring that she would receive his full attention. Naesala looked to her and was met with curious, wide eyes. He turned away, head facing ahead, and mumbled a thoughtful \"hmm\" and nothing more. An indignant puff came from the heron next to him, which only provoked him to smirk and stay quiet even longer to agitate her. The silence hardly lasted long, though, as with their next upward glide over a mountain peak, Naesala\"s plotted destination was revealed. \"We\"re going there,\" he said without looking back, instead flicking his chin forward to bring attention to the shoreline. When she saw the bleak ocean scene, a wave of disappointed washed over her as though the waves crashing against the shore were carrying her dismay. \"It is grey,\" she repeated the same observation that she had said when he had brought her to the cliffs, only without concealing the unhappiness that went along with it. He laughed off her dissatisfaction and swooped down to the rocky shore. He landed where the moving water could sweep over his boots, and then turned to face Leanne who was still hovering above. \"Come on, it has its...\" He paused to consider an appropriate word. \"...allure!\"", "\"Well, I\"d say it\"s an oasis,\" Link answered sarcastically. Katt sighed heavily, \"Thanks a bundle for your help.\" \"Come on, we\"re almost there. We\"ll find out more in detail when we arrive,\" Link suggested. And so they began to walk again, for a long time. The trees did indeed appear close by, but so did Mount Chaos off in the distance, and we know that it wasn\"t near at all. In due time, they were close enough to see exactly what the ring of trees concealed. \"Link...\" Katt said. Link turned to her and saw that she was holding the Shield of the Elements in her hands, \"Look, the topaz is glowing.\" Indeed it was true. The orange-yellow gem was glistening brighter than the other jewels. \"I guess the temple is somewhere inside that... place,\" Link concluded. \"Yup, but there\"s no doubt that this place has high security. We have to be aware of everything around us,\" Katt silently approached on of the gigantic trees, and peeked around the side, into the civilization that dwelled inside. \"Wow!\" Katt said softly, but full of expression... expression of happiness. \"What is it? What do you see?\" Link whispered to her, as he walked over. However, he got no response, \"Katt?\" he stared at her... something was different. \"I must be the happiest Gerudo in the world,\" she commented giddily with stars in her eyes. \"What is with you?\" Link wanted to shout, but knew he had to be quiet. Katt slowly lifted her hand and pointed to what dwelled inside the ring of trees; A colony of Gerudo... men, \"I would so be willing to wait a hundred years for one of these cuties.\" \"Katt! Snap out of it!\" he waved his hand I front of her face. Katt shook her head, \"Woah... sorry about that. It\"s just that it\"s nice to see so many guys that don\"t look like Ganondorf.\" \"You are a sad, little, desperate Gerudo girl,\" Link observed. \"Yeah, yeah,\" Katt muttered, \"But look at them! They\"re perfect! How can you not find them perfect?\" \"You know, I\"m thinking it\"s because I\"m more interested in GIRLS.\" \"Good point,\" Katt credited Link, \"But how are we going to get in there without being spotted and without me going crazy and hitting on all of them?\" \"Well, I don\"t know about the second one, but I think we can sneak around, but you may have to injure some of your sweethearts.\" \"OK!\" Katt grinned. Link was silent for a moment, \"I am just glad that you don\"t like me.\" \"And that you should!\" she winked at Link, \"How are we going to do this?\" \"Well, if these guys go down as easy as...\" Link changed his sentence as he caught Katt\"s glare, \"The same way as the Gerudo of Hyrule, then all we need to do is shoot them with an arrow.\" \"Simple enough,\" Katt agreed while pulling an arrow out of its quiver, \"Let\"s get started, shall we?\" Link pulled out his bow, \"OK, let\"s go!\" While remaining concealed, Link and Katt swiftly launched arrows at each of the Gerudo guarding the castle in the centre of the oasis. Katt always saying something like \"I\"m sorry, my darling!\" after each arrow was launched. Everything was going fine, until Link tripped over a rock and fell into one of the (refreshing) pools of water. All of the Gerudo that were still in tact, turned to the direction the splash came from and captured Link. Katt has stayed hidden during the commotion, and was now left with the responsibility of rescuing Link. \"Oh, what am I going to do?\" Katt was once again leaning against one of the giant trees, just outside of the oasis, \"They must have taken him into the castle... I have to get in there... Senkrad is depending on it... the Deku Tree is depending on it... Link is depending on it... those hunky Gerudo are depending on it! OK, that settles it! I have to take my risks! I told Link that risks would be necessary, and now it\"s time to prove it! In I go!\" Katt slipped through two of the large trees and entered the oasis once again. This time, she did not bring harm to any of the Gerudo... she was alone and did not want to draw attention to herself. Katt sidled along the castle walls and slid into the first doorway she found. \"Link,\" Katt whispered as she navigated the empty paths. It was so empty and spacious that even her soft whisper echoed. But she wasn\"t about to take the chance of someone hearing her shouting \"LINK!' Oh, no one\"s here... she leaned against the stone walls with her hand, and her hand seemed to sink into the wall, \"AH!!\" she couldn\"t resist screaming as she fell through the wall, \"Ugh...\" she got to her feet and observed the area. \"Good job, Katt,\" she heard a voice mutter from across the hallway. It was Link, sitting in a dungeon, as she was. Katt turned around and saw that iron bars now covered the wall she had fallen through, \"Well, I got further than you did.\" \"Fair enough,\" Link agreed. \"Do not speak in my dungeon!\" another voice interrupted the conversation, \"This is not a place for socializing. You have both intruded the sacred Gerudo Oasis.\" The heroes turned and saw a Gerudo approaching them. Unlike the other Gerudo, whom all appeared dark, this one was wearing orange that matched his fiery hair. \"I am Mordred, leader of Senkrad\"s Gerudo tribe. Do you have any excuses for entering my kingdom?\" he asked, looking straight at the dungeon pathway ahead of him, refusing to look Link or Katt in the eye. \"Yes, Your Highness,\" Katt attempted to gain Mordred\"s trust, \"We do not mean to intrude, but simply to aid the oasis, and all of Senkrad at that.\" \"What help do I need?\" Link erupted, \"Well, in case you haven\"t noticed, genius, this land is a little dark! We\"re here to help you all by killing the damn evil!!\" Katt heaved a sigh. Link had pretty much blown the chance of Mordred getting along with them. \"We have been living this way for centuries. There is no way that two strangers can help us now.\" \"Yes we can,\" Katt pleaded, \"Please... we know what we are doing. We have already begun to restore peace, by completing the task in Deku Plain... please, allow us to destroy the evil of the Oasis Temple.\" Mordred was beginning to be annoyed, \"No one may enter the Oasis Temple!\" he turned to Katt and finally had a look at the threat of his kingdom. All darkness seemed to have left his eyes, \"You... are... one of us...\" \"Huh?\" Katt blinked. \"You are the female Gerudo of legend! Destined to save us with the companionship of the little-elf-boy!\" \"Little-elf-boy?\" Link clenched his fists, \"Companion? She\"s the one helping me!!\" Mordred ignored Link\"s outburst, \"I apologize,\" Mordred put his hand through the cell bars and held Katt\"s hand. \"Erm...\" Katt tried to shift away. \"Please, allow my people to aid you in any way we can.\" \"Uh... sure,\" Katt was a little freaked out, \"Start by letting go of me and releasing both my friend and I... uh... please?\" \"Most certainly,\" Mordred agreed. He took out a key and opened the cells that held Katt and Link, \"You must both be tired from your journeys. Let us go and have a great feast to celebrate the beginning of our freedom!\" \"Yay! Food!\" Link shouted excitedly. \"What about you, heroine? Do you wish to join us?\" Mordred asked Katt. \"Yeah... I go where Link goes,\" Katt answered. Mordred looked confused, \"But why would you follow your companion?\" \"Again with the companion!?\" Link exclaimed, \"SHE is the companion! I am the hero!!\" Katt nodded in agreement, \"Link has always been the hero of Hyrule.\" \"Clearly there is much to be explained,\" Mordred stated, \"We shall talk over dinner.\" And so Link and Katt followed Mordred as he led them through the castle pathways. *~* End of Chapter 11 *~* *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Poor, poor Katt. That Mordred is frightening... BWAHAHAHAHA!! *cough* Ahem... anyway, please review and let me know what you thought! I\"ll work on writing more when I can! ^_^ I\"m so sorry it took SO long to update!! I\"ve had so much school work, other fan fics to work on and... of course... a fun writer\"s block. (-- Insert sarcasm here) Well! Here\"s the next chapter! Enjoy!! *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* The Legend of Zelda: Dark World *~* Chapter 12 - A True Ally *~* Link stuffed his mouth full of the food Mordred had served, \"This evil Gerudo stuff isn\"t half bad!\" he said with a mouth-full of food. \"Watch your manners, Link,\" Katt said, embarrassed. Mordred laughed, \"Please, do not worry about it! I have seen much worse manners!\" but his soon instantly changed from carefree to serious, \"Now... you must explain to me what this \"journey\" of yours is.\" \"Oh yeah,\" Link remembered, \"Where is the temple??\" he stood up and slammed his fist on the table. \"Link! Why are you acting so... not like yourself?\" Katt asked, a little lost for words. Link was silent in thought for a moment, \"You know what? You\"re insaneness is rubbing off on me!\" he brushed off his arms, \"I feel unclean...\" Katt rolled her eyes, and then noticed Mordred\"s blank expression, \"Oh! Sorry, Mordred! We still haven\"t explained why we\"re looking for the temple. You see... we\"re on a quest to destroy the dragon - as we\"ve mentioned - But there\"s more to it than just going and killing it... there\"s a whole spiritual thing involved.\" Link sat back down, \"I\"ll take it from here... There are these five pieces of a dragon statue, one in each of the five temples across Senkrad. If we get them all, we should be able to defeat the dragon. So that\"s why we need to get to the temple in this oasis.\" \"I see...\" Mordred nodded in understanding, \"Well, you\"re in luck! It just so happens that I\"m the one who can get you into the temple!\" \"Go figure...\" Katt muttered. Mordred stood up and motioned them to follow, \"Come on. We have no time to lose!\" Link and Katt obeyed, and followed the dark Gerudo. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ \"We have arrived!\" Mordred held his arms out, showing the... temple? There was not a thing there... only a small lake. \"Um... Mordred...\" Katt began. \"Yes?\" \"Where\"s the temple?\" \"Here.\" \"Where?\" Link joined in. \"Right here!\" \"I don\"t see it,\" Katt insisted. \"Well, of course you don\"t!\" Mordred stated. Link and Katt simply blinked in reply, \"I suppose that you just don\"t understand...\" Link and Katt nodded in agreement, \"Well then, perhaps you will understand now...\" Mordred knelt by the lake and chanted some words in a language that Link and Katt could not comprehend. As if replying to Mordred\"s strange words, the ground begun to shake. Link and Katt struggled to keep their balance as a gigantic building rose from the water. Once all was settled, Mordred got to his feet, \"Now do you see?\" \"Kind of hard not to...\" Link said, staring at the temple. \"Indeed,\" Katt agreed. \"Well then,\" Mordred began, \"I suppose you ought to enter it... but before you do, please, take this with you,\" he held out a glass bottle... but the glass was black and opaque. \"What is it?\" Link asked. \"You\"ll find out when the time is right,\" he said in reply, \"Open it when you are one hundred percent that your opponent is more than you can handle,\" he handed the bottle to Katt. \"Thanks...\" Katt stated with a confused tone in her voice. \"Don\"t worry,\" Mordred assured, \"You\"ll know when it is necessary to be opened. Now go. The temple awaits you.\" \"Good-bye, Mordred! And thank you for your help!\" Link called as he entered the temple, followed by a silent Katt. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ The second that they stepped into the temple, their obstacle was apparent... \"AH!!!! What the hell is this blinding light!?!?\" Katt shielded her eyes. Link did the same, \"I have no idea... the first temple was dark, and this one is light...\" \"Do you think that if I open the bottle...\" Katt began before she was interrupted by Link. \"NO!!\" he protested, \"As much as I\"d like to believe that we\"d be able to see clearly if we opened that bottle... it isn\"t the right time yet.\" Katt sighed, \"Yeah... I know...\" They stood in silence for a moment, deep in thought of a way to navigate through the dungeon. Suddenly, a faint chattering echoed through the room, \"Link...\" \"Yes?\" \"Do you hear that?\" \".... Yes.\" \"What is it?\" \"I... don\"t know...\" Link scanned the area - but the radiance was keeping him from spotting whatever was out there. He thought that he could see something moving within the light; however he was not certain, until... \"Link!! Boes!!\" Katt cried. She lifted her sword and swiftly let it fall directly in front of her - the shriek of a boe alerted any creature dwelling in the dungeon that opponents had arrived. \"Boes...' Link thought back to his adventures, and the small, ghostly creatures that dwelled in Woodfall and Snowhead, \"Not good...' boes blended in perfectly with their environment. Their colour and texture made them practically impossible to spot... but their glowing eyes gave them away. Link charged his blade and used the \"spin dash\" technique to take out a large group of boes. It seemed that as the boes were defeated, the light faded... \"Katt! Keep killing boes!\" \"Gotcha...\" Katt understood Link\"s command. She pulled out her bow and armed it with an ice arrow. Katt released the string, sending the arrow flying toward a cluster of boes. Once they were frozen solid, she finished them off with her sword. Link and Katt continued their techniques until the room was dimmed and the boes were defeated. Link took a deep breath after knocking the last boe down, \"Finally...\" he look around the room - it was huge. There was no door in sight. No path. No escape... \"Great... what do we do now?\" \"Check this out!\" Katt was kneeling over what appeared to be a small tide pool, \"This pool is deeper than it looks...\" she dangled her fingers in the water, \"It\"s narrow, yet seems endless...\" Link observed it over her shoulder, \"There seems to be an underwater tunnel,\" he stated, \"Go in and check it out!\" \"What?! Why me?!\" Katt objected, \"You need to come in, too!\" \"Yeah, I know,\" Link shoved Katt into the water, \"I\"m right behind you!\" he jumped in after her. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ Link pulled himself out of the water and joined Katt on the sandy shoreline. The area that they were in truly appeared as an oasis. The sand of the desert beneath their feet, but many trees and other various plants surrounded them. They both took a moment to catch their breath before speaking again, \"So what\"s this place?\" Katt shrugged, \"How should I know?\" \"Because you\"re a smartass know-it-all,\" Link said in response. \"No... I\"m just a Gerudo,\" Katt mocked her own race. Link couldn\"t help but laugh. It was true. Any and all of the Gerudo that he met were know-it-alls. \"Hey, Link. We need to get out of here; and I see the way,\" she pointed toward a door on the other side of the room; however there was a lock keeping them from passing through. \"Uh huh... but do you see any ways that we can actually get through?\" Link asked in the tone of an adult trying to bribe a child. Katt snarled, \"No.\" \"Well, I think that I do,\" Link got to his feet and walked over to a growth of vines attached to a wall, \"Check this out,\" he slashed at the plant - revealing a hidden pathway, \"Follow me!\" he called back to Katt as he headed through the tunnel. Katt obeyed and followed. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ Drip... drip... small droplets of water fell from the leaves of the trees. Link and Katt stepped cautiously into the small room. It seemed quite desolate. \"Well this was a waste of time,\" Katt said, \"There\"s nothing here to help us get through that door.\" Link opened his mouth to comment... but stopped when he heard a rustling in the trees above them. He looked up and noticed a shadow leaping from tree to tree. \"...Link?\" Katt tilted her head in confusion. \"Ssh!\" Link covered Katt\"s mouth and proceeded watching the shadow in the trees. It soared through the air, and landed in front of the warriors. \"A... Keaton...?\" Link asked himself aloud. The dark fox-like creature in front of him seemed so much gloomier than the bright and wise Keaton of Termina, \"I am glad that you remember me, Link.\" \"Wait... you\"re THE Keaton that I met in Termina!?\" Link exclaimed. The Keaton nodded, \"Much like a storm, I travel wherever the world guides me. I was sent to Senkrad... something in my mind told me that it needed my help... and it does... it needs my help to be put out of its misery!\" \"What are you saying?\" Link could not believe the words coming from the Keaton\"s mouth, \"You\"re not like this. Keatons want to help!\" \"And that\"s what I\"m doing,\" the beast insisted, \"There is no more hope... so I am helping by ending it.\" Katt, who had been silent, finally put in her opinion, \"That isn\"t helping. What Link and I are doing... that\"s helping. Not even trying to fix things is basically sentencing this world to ruin!\" \"Then so be it...\" the Keaton charged at Katt. Without hesitation, Katt reached for the bottle Mordred had given her, and opened it. A light escaped, and assembled itself on the ground. It took on the form of a mask... a mask that resembled the face of the Keaton... only it was yellow, and not black. Link shot Katt a \"what are you doing!?' look. But she simply motioned toward the Keaton. Link obeyed her signal, and turned his attention toward the Keaton. It was slowly approaching the mask with fear in its eyes. The Keaton looked down, then held its own paw in front of its eyes, \"I am not... myself...\" it said at last, \"This isn\"t me... that is...\" it examined the mask. It sat down and placed its left paw on the mask, \"What have I done?\" \"There\"s still hope for you,\" Katt knelt down by the Keaton, \"You can become yourself again, and help us...\" she picked up the mask and held it in front of the Keaton\"s face. A brilliant light shone for a moment, and then evaporated into the air. During that split second, the Keaton had been restored to its original state of hope. \"Thank you, warrior,\" the Keaton said, \"You have saved me from the darkness of this world. It engulfs nearly all who enter it... but somehow, you have both escaped it. I am Xyghan. Thank you... both of you.\" \"There\"s no need to thank us,\" Link said, \"It\"s all part of getting through the temple.\" \"No!\" Katt broke in, \"There\"s more to it than that. If we had the help of you, Xyghan, this quest would...\" \"Wait a second!!\" Link dragged Katt away from the Keaton, \"Are you crazy? Don\"t you remember what Rio said? \"Only a handful of people can be trusted, and you will be fine without their help.'\" \"Well, if you ask me... Rio wasn\"t doing so great living by those rules. Link, if Xyghan has been in this temple for basically as long as he\"s been in Senkrad, then he can help us find our way through!\" \"But Katt...\" \"Just trust me on this one,\" Katt assured, \"Plus, if all else fails, we can kill it.\" \"Fair enough...\" Link gave in, \"All right, Keaton. You can travel with us.\" \"Good,\" Xyghan said, \"Because you wouldn\"t get much farther without me,\" he turned and bounded toward one of the trees. Reaching into the tree\"s hollow with his paw, Xyghan pulled out a key. He nudged it towards Katt, \"Here. We need this key to get through the door of the previous room.\" \"Oh... so THAT\"S where that key was...\" Link gave a fake smile. Katt smirked, \"Wow... that\"s some awesome skill there, \"Hero of Time\".\" \"Quiet, Katt,\" Link said. \"Actually,\" Xyghan joined the conversation, \"Link is indeed a great hero, Katt. He saved Termina from the evil Majora\"s Mask. There is no denying that he will not save this land, as well.\" Link grinned triumphantly, \"Thanks, Keaton!\" he headed back toward the room he and Katt had formerly been in. Xyghan followed. Katt stood behind for a minute, \"Seriously... Where the hell is Termina!?\" she shouted after them. No reply. Katt growled under her breaths, \"Idiots... Hey!! Guys!! Wait for me!!\" she chased after Link and Xyghan, so they could continue their adventure through the Oasis Temple. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Hooray!! I am FINALLY done this new chapter! Oh, and mastershadow64, the name Katt has a history with me. It\"s from some old video game for SNES... Can\"t remember the name, though. o.0 Anyway... for as long as I can remember, \"Katt\" has been my code name in video games, etc... Right, so... PLEASE review and tell me what you think of this chapter and the rest of my story! I will try to update as soon as I can!! With Christmas vacation soon, it should work out! OK, Link enters. Something you\"ll understand (I hope so. o.0) Um... yeah. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* The Legend of Zelda: Dark World *~* Chapter 2 - The Forest\"s Outsider *~* \"You will go on another journey... An adventure... But you will not go alone... You will have a companion to aid you save the world...\" Link\"s eyes opened. He sat up on his bed and looked around his small house, no one was there. it was dead silent. \"Just a voice of my dreams,\" he said to himself. \"LINK!!\" \"Woah!\" startled by the yell, Link fell off of his bed, \"What a way to start the day...\" he muttered, getting to his feet. \"Link! Will you get your lazy arse down here!!\" the voice called again. Link walked through the doorway into the bright sunlight of Kokiri Forest, \"Saria... give me a break... it\"s too early for yelling...\" he said, rubbing his eyes. \"Too early?\" the green-haired girl said sarcastically, \"Look above you! The sun\"s at its high point! It\"s past noon! Anyway, there\"s no time for this argument today. An outsider has entered the forest!\""]}
{"id": "9e5c6e75-032e-5ae1-9642-eafdc7de64ad", "fandoms": ["League of Legends", "Transformers/Beast Wars"], "pair": ["Inhaling the fresh, sweet air of her grove lightly, Soraka turned back his way and looked upward to the green leaves of a nearby tree, her grin still there on her face, but overall expression transparent to her true emotions. \"I would rather not say.\" Like a fool pouring gasoline upon a budding flame with the hopes of extinguishing it, her excuse only fueled the chimera\"s curiosity tenfold. \"Is there something wrong with those days?\" \"It is merely a private matter of mine.\" She waved her hand nonchalantly. Her head swiveled slowly back to him, her expression composed and cheerful. \"A very sensitive subject. One that I have rarely shared with anyone, and would prefer to... keep to myself.\" Even though he wished to probe further and perhaps uncover whatever this odd secret might have been, Warwick decided to stay in his current boundaries. His tail swishing behind himself twice in minor vexation, he grunted in understanding, lowering his head and closing his eyes. \"Then very well; I will not come to you on those nights, Soraka.\" \"Thank you.\" Sincerity in her tone, Soraka sighed and approached her friend, the smile on her face now again as radiant as the setting sun. His eyes opening and peering her way again, Warwick looked at the Starchild and her euphoric expression coming ever so close to him. He looked at her undeniable beauty, unknowing as to how he could extend his conversation before it inevitably soured and turned more awkward than it surely was already. Fearing that outcome, he chose to end it instead. \"Goodbye for now.\" He turned away with a jerking motion, reluctantly ripping his view from her. \"I may return, if I find another opportunity to do so. But then again, I might not.\" Soraka hummed, \"Well, in either case, I would love to have you over again. I honestly do. Farewell, Warwick. Until next we hopefully meet.\" \"\"Hopefully\",\" he murmured back, heavy skepticism in his tone that Soraka did not believe for even a second. Falling on all fours, Warwick dug his heels into the grass-covered dirt below him and took off. He was soon gone, and with his departure Soraka was immediately embraced by an old acquaintance of hers she put up with so very often. Solitude. Solitude was a most lonesome thing. But with solitude came truest peace. With solitude came time to reflect. It was then when an idea entered her mind. It was a hope-filled idea aimed toward the future, and it made her beam with richest delight. Unable to find any reason not to halt herself, she chose to act on it. Soraka wandered through her grove with her staff in hand, her stride almost a mirthful skip. The Starchild continued on in this way for a trivial length of time until she come across something large laying upon the ground, sitting harmlessly over the green grass. It was a log of old, dead wood that had fallen some time ago. Wood from the gloamwood trees, to be specific. Artists treasured the material for more physical projects since it was well known for both its pliability and long-lasting durability against the likes of time and even exposure to the elements. Mostly was it used for sculpting or carving a wide variety of ceremonial items, and Soraka had, in fact, learned to do so as well. Some of her founded skill was learned from those who had passed by her domain from either trouble or wish to simply use the grove\"s beauty as a form of inspiration. The rest of it was from time and endless hours of practice and self-teaching. After collecting a sizable portion of the wood in one of her hands, the Starchild got back up and moved on, humming most happily. Reaching her next destination, a grey, moss-covered boulder, she set aside her wood and staff on the side of a tree and knelt down in front of it. Lifting the large rock almost effortlessly, she gazed into the dark soil it once covered and saw the item she was after hidden within - a knife. The tool possessed a long, curled, silver blade, and etched along its wooden handle like slithering snakes were several minuscule blessings, written in an older Ionian dialect. Sighing in reverie, Soraka grabbed the knife, gripping it well in one of her hands as she pulled it from its spot. It was a carving knife, one of the variety artists used to craft wood, no matter their size, into masterworks; the variety bearing a blade made of ancient metals that scarcely dulled. This particular one was a gift from one of the artists who visited her so very long ago. He was a fellow of robust workmanship who had come to her home in the hopes of creating a sculpture in the fabled Starchild\"s likeness. Soraka was more than happy to oblige him, and posed as still as stone for a great many hours just for his project. He offered the item to her in appreciation of her assistance after he had completed his grand work, and while Soraka stated that she needed no such thing, he insisted she take it with no intent on hearing her refuse. With the knife in one hand and the recollected block of aged and lifeless wood tucked under her shoulder, Soraka leisurely sauntered through her grove, all as her staff left its spot and floated after her. It was almost as though an obedient current of wind had swept it up as easily as a bird\"s feather. Soon did Soraka come across another great tree she liked to visit, with an immensely thick trunk extending many hundreds of feet above the ground. Upon its branches were leaves of a reflective, ashen black. With only a cheerful expression on her face, which was shown just as plainly in her movements, Soraka, followed swiftly by her staff, moved up to the ancient plant\"s base and sat down between two of its mighty roots that extended into the soil. Placing the piece of wood on the grass before her, Soraka eyed it for a long while, thinking of exactly the kind of work she wanted to make it into. With care, she brought the knife\"s silver blade to the wood\"s hide and began her task with steady vigor. She whittled and carved it away piece by piece, slowly, slowly crafting the object into another shape entirely... Night was upon Zaun when Warwick reached its unforgettable shores at last, having swam the whole way there. He swam and then waded through the last few hundred meters of the murky water until he stood upon dry land, shaking himself and his shaggy fur dry when he was done. He felt only somewhat weary from the trip, and there was little doubt in his mind that it had to do with his resting in that Astral Grove. Upon the lap of that strange, beautiful being - that Starchild - were his greatest torments rendered numb by something reminiscent of pleasure and... something else. By her mystical touch and sweet voice, his most agonizing of chemically-infused muscles and mechanical augmentations felt that less excruciating. Granted, it wasn\"t much, but the fact that it reduced the constant pain he had to endure by any measure was miraculous in and of itself. With stealth in his movements, Warwick trekked through the corrupt city of Zaun. While his senses kept track of all that went on around him and how to elude and maneuver about the bustling metropolis of unchecked ingenuity and rampant capitalism, he kept his mind fixed on another image for the journey - that dream he had. He still remembered what Soraka had told him, about keeping his memory fresh. With any shred of hope or luck, perhaps it would come to him. Perhaps he could uncover the secret behind this mysterious \"Inna\" and who she was... As he reached and then walked through the grime-coated pipeline leading to his lair, all he could think of the woman as he saw her in his dream. That familiar image that had presented itself to him in an almost taunting manner. It was not a memory of pain but of pure perturbation; it was a memory of something that had taken place sometime before he became the fiend he was now, but it was not an event he recalled. That much he did know. It was just about- Warwick\"s thoughts were all equally smothered in an instant as he suddenly experienced a strange smell. The odor hit his nose with the rude abruptness of a slap to the face, and it did so greatly enough that the chimera halted in his stride. This one was new. Different from the usual stink he picked up whenever he entered his home. While it possessed a certain horridness to it like any other scent that would find itself here, it was less like the usual dull and dank smell that clung to these walls and more like the smell of food and drink that had rotted or turned, mixed with... something else. Not anything he would drag down here, that was certain. Instantly sensing something was surely amiss, Warwick grew caution in his movements forward and began prowling the rest of the way at a stalking pace. After slinking forth until a scant few meters rested between him and the opening of his den, he heard a sound of scuffling. Soon after, a voice went out with it. \"Oh, this doesn\"t smell at all!\" it seemed to complain, its tone scratchy, high-pitched, and clearly male. \"But no matter; a little stench and it\"ll be perfect. And what\"s this? Who would leave this lying around? It\"s so shiny, hee-hee! Oh, the fool who left these out surely wasn\"t thinking straight, hee-hee-hee!\" Warwick\"s brow furrowed and his lips raised, exposing his teeth. A growl began to rumble within his throat as the individual within his home went on speaking, giving off a sour huff as it uncovered something else. It squeaked out, \"Honestly, some people have no decency to just let their food wither and spoil. This old meat isn\"t even covered in maggots yet! Ugh...\" With that, Warwick realized whatever manner of scavenger this was had discovered his cache of dried meat he kept away as rations in the small circumstance that he left him unable to hunt. He hadn\"t touched the stuff in so long that he had nearly forgotten it was there, but the fact that a stranger was defiling his belongings still infuriated him enough. Acting on this rousing bit of anger, he hastily turned the final corner and peered into his den. What he first noticed, standing almost directly in the center of his abode, was a short, gaunt, inhuman figure, his back aimed at the chimera. The little flesh of him that was exposed at this angle was enveloped in short fur that matched the color of the mold that commonly grew on sewer pipes, and a cloud of black flies buzzed around his head. Extending from its rump was a long, dark, scaly, bandage-covered tail that twitched about every few seconds like a worm undergoing electric therapy. He was clad in the filthy remnants of what seemed like either a trench coat or waistcoat, but the sleeves it once surely bore had been gnawed off at some point another so it\"s scrawny, weedy forelimbs could poke through with zero resistance. Upon his left shoulder and arm rested a makeshift pauldron and gauntlet of sorts, both crafted from a scavenged bit of broken metal. A crossbow-like weapon was strung around his back, alongside what appeared to be a pair of fist-sized glass casks filled with sickly green fluids, but Warwick couldn\"t discern exactly what the stuff was. What he could detect more than anything about this unwelcome intruder was the unfathomably rancid odor it gave off, which to say was worse than the one it left behind in the tunnel, and almost caused his eyes to water the moment he caught a whiff of it in all its noxiousness. \"Hey!\" he bellowed at last, his fangs gnashing together. Its pointed, flea-bitten ears shooting upward in alarm, the rat-creature\"s body spun around, showing its face. Upon the back of his thin, long snout were a set of simple goggles, their lenses almost blurred to the point of translucence with the layers of unwashed grime that caked it. Within them, just barely visible, were a pair of beady, bloodshot eyes that practically glowed red. The ratlike creature unleashed an earsplitting shriek upon seeing what beast had discovered it sifting through its den uninvited. Fumbling with the materials it had already grabbed ahold of until they all spilled back onto the ground with a clatter, it then reached its bony, claw-tipped fingers for the weapon around its back. After the being had grabbed it and began pointing it forward, it was much clearer to see that he device itself looked indeed like an old and worn-down, but still stable crossbow, powered by chem technology. Affixed to its rearmost part, right above the wooden handle and filled to its cracked brim with only the most noxious and green chemicals that surely ran it, was a glass reminiscent of an upside-down chemistry flask. Unleashing its prepped arrow, a bolt shot forth with a hollow twang of the bowstrings, its barbed tip visible in the low light, practically gleaming with the foul substances that saturated it. In that instant, the bolt hit Warwick, piercing through the flesh of his left shoulder. It was a swift and dense pain, like that of a piercing bee\"s sting. While it seemed no worse than that, it was not something he was going to ignore. Warwick stepped back and quickly put his hand to the bolt, pulling it from his flesh. Taking just a quick look at it, he glared at its barbed tip, now also coated in his red blood alongside its venom and grime. Warwick\"s next glance was shot back to the ratman. To his immense agitation, the string on his crossbow had automatically reset itself. Another saturated arrow, coated in just as many vile liquids and waste, was swiftly placed in the arrow track by its wielder. With a crazed laugh he launched it, then another and another, all shot with the poorest of accuracy to guide them. Warwick leapt away the moment his newest foe starting shooting, avoiding the coming projectiles with his quickness. Running in circles for a moment, he found a large, empty metal barrel sitting on the corner of the den, and so ducked behind it. \"It\"s mine! It\"s all mine! I licked it!\" the ratman cried out with another maddened laugh, firing a second volley of bolts at the sheltered chimera. As the bolts all missed or deflected off of the his cover\"s surface, Warwick looked again at the arrow he had previously been shot by, snapping the thing in two in his hand. Already he could feel the stinging poisons it injected him with festering in his bloodstream, but it was a minor pain that would surely leave. Grumbling in disgust, he tossed the broken bolt away. Sitting there, he waited for an opening to arise. Just a single one, so that he could pounce on his enemy. Lo and behold, his opportunity indeed came, almost as soon as the current volley of bolts ended. \"Out of ammo?\" the ratman said, apparently to himself. \"Oh, wait a second... I\"m sure I left a few more bolts in my-\" Taking this chance, Warwick lunged from his cover silently, catching the ratman off guard. With a single, sweeping swipe he hit the crossbow out of its thin claws, sending it sliding to the floor. The creature screeched in fear and tried to jump away as soon as it realized what was happening, but by then it was too late. Chasing him down, Warwick sent his left claw forth, grabbing the ratman by the scruff of his neck. With his prey caught, Warwick stood tall and looked at it in its red eyes, hoisting him a few feet from the ground. \"Please don\"t kill me!\" the ratman cried in terror, lifting his arms up to shield his rodent face. \"Please don\"t! I-I was only looking through this place for stuff to scavenge! I didn\"t know anyone a-actually lived here!\" \"Then what of the fool who left all of this trash here \"lying around\"?\" queried Warwick, his eyes resembling two red flames that seemed eager to feed the oversized rat to the fire. \"Don\"t think I didn\"t hear you chittering with glee about uncovering my belongings. I know what you\"re about...\" The ratman lifted a quivering finger to respond, but failed to come up with anything to defend himself. He was caught in the blatant lie like his smaller, unmutated relatives in a mousetrap. Warwick raised his right claw to the creature, his metal claws extending in preparation to gut this loathsome, unwelcome intruder. Sensing his looming demise, the ratman threw his hands up in a panic. \"Y-you don\"t understand!\" he squeaked. \"I-i-if you spare me, I\"m sure we can come to a-a-a m-more proper understanding! I\"ll do anything you want, please!\" Warwick paused. A brow lifting, his aggressive stance began to falter. Lowering his readied claw, he eyed Twitch carefully and snorted. \"Give me a reason not to kill you, pest. One good reason...\" The verminous creature gulped. His forepaws coming against one another, the rat-creature tapped his index claws together in a most manner, evidently thinking of a way to worm his way out of his dire predicament. \"Well... I... I like being alive. Does that count?\" The ratman shrugged innocently, hoping to receive a positive response. He gave up the when he saw Warwick\"s lip begin to raise in a coming snarl. \"Okay, okay!\" he squealed next, flinching away. \"I-I know who you are! I heard you like to hunt awful people! Folks in Zaun say that you like to devour those who do wrong! B-but I\"m not evil. I just... do what I need to do to survive. You can understand that, yes? You can see that I\"m clearly a poor, innocent person who\"s just trying to make a living, yes?\" \"No.\" The ratman flinched once more at the laconic response. \"O-okay, if not that, then... I have something that you might get out of me. And I\"m sure that it\"s something you want. You see, I... I-I can help you! I know some people you might like to eat instead of little old me...\" Warwick sniffed. \"Like who? Do you see anyone who has committed heinous crimes? Who\"s done terrible things for selfish or... sadistic reasons?\" \"I see them lots of times when I\"m running around in the sewers. They don\"t usually see me, though. But... if there\"s one thing I know about most of them, it\"s that they\"re definitely bad. Far, far worse than someone such as I.\" \"In what way?\" The fearful rodent ceased his twitching for a second. \"Hmm... well, they like to steal things I want to steal, and I remember seeing a lot of their faces on these poster things that happen to wash through the sewers. You know, the ones that say there\"s a reward for their capture, or something like that.\" \"Anything else?\" \"Yes, yes! They dump lots of things down here that I\"m sure you\"ll want to know about. Trash, chemicals, bodies, you name it.\" \"Really?\" Warwick hummed in a most intrigued manner, his grip around the mutant creature slacking. When he realized what he was doing, he was quick to reaffirm it. \"How else do you know that they are among the type that I hunt?\" \"I-I\"ve heard them whisper about how safe they feel from time to time! S-safe from you! It\"s true!\" he squeaked, covering his eyes. \"That\"s all I know! Please don\"t hurt me! I taste awful!\" Instead of taking a bite of the repulsive creature as it feared, Warwick asked, \"What\"s your name?\" \"Twitch,\" he replied. \"J-just Twitch.\" \"You\"re a lucky rat, Twitch,\" said Warwick, setting him down to the cool floor but keeping his grip firm. \"I may just have a use for you after all.\" \"W-well, assuming that it\"s within my powers, I, uh... just might be able to help, heh...\" he snickered, feigning the loss of his fear, if quite poorly. \"...What is it you want from me?\" \"If I let you go, and you in turn find out about where these supposed bad folks dwell, then listen to what I say next: If you come back to me and tell me about them, I will not harm you.\" He let out a laugh that came out more like a half-snarl. \"In fact, I might find it in my heart to reward you for such assistance. Can you perform this?\" \"Oh, yes, yes! That I can do! I can tell you everything I know, yes!\" Twitch instantly, almost eagerly started, as Warwick began walking with him closer to the entrance of his lair. \"As a matter of fact, I saw some people that might interest you earlier today. They were in the back pipeline of Odd Kwinge\"s, not two days ago. It\"s a small bar north from here, in the area just below Dingy Street. I think. I found these two guys getting rid of three bodies wrapped in bags, talking about how they didn\"t want anyone to \"uncover more of their evidence\". I even heard one of them call the other \"Fat Gerald\". I saw them hanging around there twice before, and I bet my tail they live somewhere around it as well. I\"m positive that you\"ll want to eat them over me. That Gerald guy\"s even a plump, juicy piece of-\" \"Shut up,\" commanded Warwick, the amiability in his voice gone again. Twitch shivered and did what he was coldly told. Huffing, the chimera regarded the oversized rat with a serious mien. \"You heard what I said. All I want is reliable information. Are you up to this task?\" \"If it means you won\"t kill me, then yes,\" was how Twitch answered, nodding his flea-bitten, rodent-esque head rapidly for a good five seconds. \"Then good.\" Warwick let go of Twitch\"s neck, dropping him to the floor like a sack of rubbish. Rubbing his paws over the scruff of his neck where the lupine beast had grabbed ahold of him, Twitch looked up to Warwick as he took a step back, giving the ratman a chance of having space to stand. \"You\"re free to go. And do try to remember our bargain.\"", "\"Is there a way to reverse the effects?\" Arcee\"s concerned-sounding voice cut in. \"No\" Knock Out\"s responded. \"We tried to find a way to fix it, but there\"s nothing we can do!\" \"So you\"re both saying this he could mutate any cycle now?\" Bumblebee\"s voice said. \"Yes\" Ratchet responded, glumly. \"...And judging by how rapid his genetic makeup is changing, he could very well turn into something nobody can control.\" I heard enough. I opened the door, and looked out, seeing each bot outside it swerving their heads to me in surprise. \"K-Kickback?\" Ratchet stuttered. \"H-how much of that did you hear?\" He asked. \"A lot...\" I replied in a muffled tone, suppressing my anger as best I could. \"Now, listen, let me explain...\" Knock Out began. \"First off, we found that your CNA was dangerously unstable, which is, uh, the reason we called you down last night...\" I tried to calm myself. \"What... What am I turning into THIS time, time, time?\" I asked. \"Well... We\"re not sure\" Ratchet replied. \"The change could be extremely minor, or it could be... Tremendous.\" \"We just don\"t have the technology to fix this kind of thing!\" Knock Out said again. \"The only bot I ever knew who excelled in this kind of field was Shockwave, but considering his allegiances, I don\"t think he\"d really want to help.\" \"None of us even know where he is!\" I cried out, clasping my head with my servos. \"Why me? Why? Why? Why?\" I despaired, turning and walking back into the lab, kicking a cupboard as I passed it. I swept a servo across a nearby desk, shattering and scattering small pieces of lab equipment as I let out a roar of anger. \"I... Needed that...\" Ratchet muttered as I continued my small rampage. \"Kickback, calm down! Don\"t let it control you!\" Bulkhead shouted. His words snapped me out of my stupor as I turned and looked at him. \"What am I sssupposed to do?\" I said back at him. \"I\"m going to mutate again at any cycle now, and there\"s nothing we can do to stop it!\" Suddenly, a red light shown throughout the base, followed by a buzzing noise. \"Oh, now what?\" I asked. \"The communications system!\" Ratchet answered, immediately turning and running toward the groundbridge. My plight temporarily forgotten, they all turned and followed Ratchet. \"What about me?\" I moaned. Bulkhead stopped running and looked at me. \"When it\"s like that, it\"s a signal from the Cons\" he answered before continuing his run to rejoin them. \"Oh\" I said to myself. \"Wait for me!\" I yelled as I, too, began running. I approached where the others were listening in, and I saw Ratchet press a device on the computer board. An image of Starscream appeared on the screen above it. \"Hello, Autobots\" he said in his usual, conniving tone. \"What do you want, Scream?\" Arcee asked. \"The answer is very simple, actually\" he said again, smile creeping onto his face. \"I recently caught wind of a new member in your little group, Tailslide, was he?\" \"Not anymore\" I said. He turned his head to me. \"It\"s Kickback now.\" \"Whatever...\" He replied. \"The point I\"m getting to, is that I\"m seeking a little... \"Exhange.\"\" \"Heh. For what?\" Ratchet asked. Starscream smirked. \"Why, for this little snoop I found trying to get to you, of course!\" He said, shifting the camera to focus on a blue-and-white bot, on his knees, next to him, stasis cuffs around his arms. Upon closer inspection, the bot looked like bumblebee, with the exception of his head, and he looked dented and burnt in some parts. \"M-Mirage?\" Ratchet stuttered. \"How in Primus...\" \"...Did I catch him?\" Starscream finished for him. \"The answer\"s quite simple, really. Soundwave heard a transmission between you and your little \"covert-operations\" specialist here, and we decided to give him our own form of greeting.\" \"You...\" Ratchet began, anger swelling up in his voice. \"I\"m sending you the coordinates of where I want to meet\" Starscream continued. \"Be there in ten cycles, or you this will be the last you see of... \"Mirage\" online\" He said, threateningly. \"Don\"t... Do it\" Mirage\"s damaged body managed to whisper just before the transmission ended. Silence erupted through the room as we all stared at the blank screen. Slowly but surely, everyone in the room began looking at me. \"Kickback?...\" Miko began, looking up at me. \"Don\"t worry, we\"ll think of-\" \"Trade me\" I said, cutting her off. \"What?\" Bulkhead, Ratchet, and Arcee said in unison. \"I sssaid... Trade me\" I demanded again. \"I know I\"m going to mutate into something beyond anyone\"s power, ssso either way, I\"m ssscrewed.\" \"Now listen...\" Knock Out said \"We still aren\"t sure what the extent of it will be, for all we know, you\"ll just grow another foot.\" \"We don\"t even have time to form a plan, plan, plan\" I replied. My left servo morphed into its blaster form and I placed the tip of the barrel on the temple of my head. Everyone near me took a step back in surprise. \"Either you trade me to them, or I\"ll off myself, here and now, and you\"ll never see Mirage again\" I said, twitching nervously, mandibles chittering as though I had lost my mind. \"Kickback, what are you doing?\" Arcee shouted. \"The right thing\" I said. She and Bulkhead slowly approached me, but when they got too close, a loud humming sound came from my blaster. \"Sssafety\"s off!\" I exclaimed. \"Any closer, and there will be no options at all, all, all!\" \"Think about what you\"re doing!\" Bulkhead yelled. \"I tried thinking...\" I started to say. \"Thinking got me here in the first place. Thinking got me into this form... I\"m not going to think anymore! I\"m acting!\" \"The mutation is beginning to affect his processor\" Knock Out said. \"I think he really means it.\" \"Ratchet...\" I began. \"We both know thisss is the only way. Open the groundbridge.\" \"No\" he replied. \"We need to make a plan. We can save both of you! Just give us some time to make a plan...\" \"Time is sssomething we don\"t have!\" I shouted. \"Lassst I checked, Starssscream sent that message four nano-kliks ago. we only have sssix left!\" I looked to my left and saw Bumblebee trying to sneak up on me. I shot him a glare and snapped the pincers on my back, threateningly. He backed off. Ratchet sighed, closed his optics and placed his face in his servo. \"Can we at least... Can we at least place a tracking device on you?\" He asked, raising his head again. \"If you agree with me, then fine, fine, fine\" I replied. He ran to his lab and returned instantly, carrying a small device that I could barely see sticking from the edge of one of his digits. \"Put this in a place they won\"t look\" he advised when he handed it to me. Upon close inspection, I noticed that the device looked square in shape. I placed it on my back, where it magnetically attached to an area between my servos. \"Thanksss\" I said in return. \"Now... Open the groundbridge\" \"You do know we can still think of other options\" Arcee said as I lowered my blaster from my head. \"I know... But I don\"t want them\" I replied. \"It\"s time I thought for myself and the group around here, and consssidering what may happen to me, thisss may be my lassst chance.\" \"That\"s not true\" Ratchet said as he inputted the coordinates into the groundbridge. \"We can save you! We just need time to find out how!\" \"That\"s not true, true, true\" I snapped as the portal opened. \"...And you know it. Now, let\"s forget about me, and go save Mirage. You can save me, later, on their ship.\" I ran headfirst into the portal, before the others could, and soon found myself in the middle of a large grassland, under a dark, early morning sky. As I heard the others follow through, I looked ahead and saw many, dark shapes, one of which was bigger than the rest. Lugnut. \"At last\" he growled in his deep, grave voice, turning to us as the last of us exited the portal, before it closed. It was just me, Arcee, Bulkhead, and Knock Out facing off against nearly two-dozen Vehicons and Lugnut. \"I see you\"ve come, abomination\" he said again as all our optics met. \"And as per our agreement...\" He began as he turned to the Vehicons. \"...Bring out the prisoner.\" As he said that, the Vehicons parted, revealing Mirage\"s blue-and-white body, bound with stasis cuffs, and blindfolded with a crude metal sheet wrapped around his optics. Two Vehicons dragged him off his knees with a grunt, and brought him to the center area of the field, dropping him in a heap. Lugnut calmly walked up to his body and took off the sheet around his blue optics. He looked around wildly until he saw us, letting out a sigh. \"H-hey...\" He muttered weakly in our direction. \"Now... You!\" Lugnut exclaimed, pointing to me. I turned my servo into a fist and started to walk forward. Bulkhead followed. \"Well...\" I started as I approached the behemoth. \"Here I am. Give Mirage to them, and I\"ll come quietly.\" \"No tricks?\" He asked. \"No tricks, tricks, tricks\" I lied, thinking of the tracking device on my back. He effortlessly lifted Mirage\"s moaning body up and threw him at Bulkhead like a rock, who barely had time to react before he slammed into him with a groan, sending Bulkhead stumbling back a few feet. \"You\"re mine now\" He suddenly said as he reached his servo down and grabbed my arm. I didn\"t resist when he slapped a pair of stasis cuffs on both of them, though I did cringe at how unimaginably tight he made them. \"Looksss like sssomebody woke up on the wrong ssside of the bed\" I muttered as he began to lead me away. \"Quiet!\" he shouted as he smacked my head. I looked back and saw my friends help Mirage, Knock Out helping him through a rapidly-opening portal. If I had a proper mouth, I\"d be smiling, but the feeling faded as soon as Lugnut spoke again. \"Now that we\"ve finished our business... Decepticons, kill them all\" As soon as he said that, each Vehicon aimed and fired at my friends, just as the portal was closing. \"No!\" I shouted as they began to defend themselves. I watched in horror when the shots fired on both sides, countless Vehicons falling, and countless blaster shots hitting my friends. A portal opened ahead of me and Lugnut. \"In you go\" he said as he pushed me toward it. I turned back, and in rage, kicked him in the knee. He let out a cry of surprise and staggered for a moment while I tried to run, but he grabbed hold of my leg as I passed him. \"Heh... You\"re not getting away from me that easy, freak\" he said as he began to lift me up. Before I could react, he flung me into the portal, and the last thing I saw before my screaming body went through it was the fight continuing. I flew through the portal into the destination, and landed on the ground, my body screeching to a grinding halt as I landed on the metal ground. I got onto my legs with a groan as I lifted myself up. I heard the portal behind me close, and when I turned, I saw the large shape of Lugnut approaching me, his single optic staring at me, menacingly. As I turned to run, he grabbed me by the scruff of my neck, and began dragging me down the hall while I tried to grapple with his servo. \"I\"ve waited a long time for this\" he mused as we continued on. \"And now, I\"m not just going to enjoy watching your spark get extinguished... I\"m going to watch it get dissected like the bug you are.\" I saw a door ahead of us open up, and Lugnut threw me in its dark room with a thud. I lifted my head up and saw a purple figure standing above me. Shockwave stared down at me, arm cannon aimed, before he slowly lowered it, and looked toward Lugnut. \"I take it that your exchange went over as planned\" he said to the behemoth. \"Yes it did...\" Lugnut said as he walked up to me. \"For once I can finally power down, and actually stay that way. Show me the footage of this... Thing\"s demise when I awake.\" \"He will be gone by this afternoon\" Shockwave said as he looked back down to me. \"Strap him onto this examination table, and you can be dismissed.\" Lugnut did so, smile on his face, grabbing me and not-so-gently placing me on the table, taking off my stasis cuffs, and stretching my arms out, despite my attempts to thwart him. Shockwave activated a button, and beams of energy flew out and wrapped around my limbs and waist, holding my grunting body in place. \"You\"re all monsters... Kickback know you all monsters!\" I yelled, then stopped talking when I realized my speech pattern changed. What was that? Why do I sound funny? I wondered. \"It even speaks wrong\" Lugnut said as he turned away. \"Have fun, doctor\" he said a final time before exiting the room. Shockwave brought out a needle and walked up to me. \"Your mutation really is fascinating\" he said as I struggled with my bonds. \"Nothing like it has ever been cataloged by science. I am privileged to be the first. You should too.\" I spat in his face when he got close to me. He merely wiped the green energon stain off his single, large optic, not even registering the level of insult I just performed. I continued to struggle. \"I do not blame your resistance\" he said as he inspected the needle. \"It is a common thing most of my experiments and test subjects do, but I\"ll have you know, nothing has broken those bonds before.\" As he finished talking, I saw and felt him stick the needle into my arm, and dark green energon seeped into its tube. I tried to grab at him with the servos on my back, but he was way out of reach. I growled in frustration and anger. \"Interesting...\" He said in a hushed voice as he examined the tube\"s contents. He walked over to a machine and drained the energon into a funnel connecting to it. Nano-kliks later, paper began to print out of it, and Shockwave grabbed the results, reading them intensely. \"Very strange... Your CNA readings have become significantly different since we last met... It appears that you\"re mutating again\" he said as he fixed his gaze back at me. \"Kickback not care. Kickback get out and destroy you\" I threatened as he picked up a vial of blue liquid and placed it inside the chamber of the same needle he just used. \"If I\"m going to have a look inside you, it would be best if you weren\"t conscious\" Shockwave said again as he pointed the needle\"s tip in my direction. He began to walk up to me, but suddenly stopped and placed the device down, raising his servo to his intercom. \"What?\" He asked into it. \"A bridge portal, here? That\"s highly illogical... Unless...\" He looked back at me. \"What\"s happening?\" I asked. \"It\"s none of your concern\" he said. He focused back to the bot on the other end of his intercom. \"Tell Starscream that I believe that the test subject has brought a tracking device on board with him\" Shockwave said again, heading toward the door. \"I\"ll be right up.\" He turned one last time to me. \"I appear to have other matters to attend to, and will be back in a while. Enjoy your stay of execution while it lasts.\" He then headed out the door, and it closed behind him, leaving me alone once again, looking around desperately for a way to escape. I continued to struggle with the energon chains wrapped around my servos and legs. Must... Get... Free... Was all I thought as vicious, primal urges began to gnaw at my mind and body. I could feel something was wrong as my limbs began to feel both unimaginably numb, and hot, like somebody had lit the energon in my fuel lines on fire. \"What is happening to Kickback?\" I screamed as the rest of my body began to follow in my arm\"s and leg\"s agony. Dark, green liquid, which I could only assume to be my own lifeblood, began to ooze out of every joint in my entire body. My left arm began to bend and snap in ways it was not meant to, making me cry out in pain. Just as my other arm started to do so as well, I realized, through my strained vision, that this pain had somehow given me the strength to break my bonds, as I noticed my left arm had broken free, and began to flail around, almost uncontrollably in the air, throwing energon around my already stained body, and the room. through either the force of sheer will, or survival, I navigated my servo to the other band around my other servo, tearing it off like a piece of paper. I groaned as I then focused my addled mind to the ones around my legs, quickly ripping them off, and moving my bottommost limbs to the ground, off the table I was on, as soon as I had done so. I tried to stand on my legs, but the nano-klik I did, I collapsed to the ground, headfirst, sending vivid flashing colors through my sight as I tried to regain my footing. The farthest I could get was onto my knees, but then I was hit by a much weirder feeling, as if I was wearing armor that didn\"t fit. \"Zzzz...\" I burbled groggily as I, instinctively, stuck my fingers into the cracks opening up on the crown of my head, energon flooding out of them like an open wound, antennas hanging lifelessly from the side. I pulled. I pulled as hard as I could with what remained of my strength, as my vision blurred. I pulled the cracks apart, in two, creating a large fissure out of the outer shell that was once my head, that soon extended to my back and chest. With a final grunt, groan, and buzz, I felt the shell give way, and a sudden feeling of my body splitting in two, followed by a cold feeling of the air on my new, wet, energon-covered body. I cried out in utter relief, one last time, before my aching body fell to the ground with a sickly splat. I began to lose consciousness in the wake of the experience, and I could feel myself drifting into sleep as my optics closed. I woke up what felt like nano-kliks later. I was on the ground, and something felt extraordinarily... different. \"What... Where...?\" I began as I looked around the unknown, albeit, very familiar environment I was in. Everything looked a different color. I could see fine, but for some reason, everything I saw looked slightly purple. \"Where... Iz... Kickback?\" I said to myself as I rubbed the back of my head, and slowly got up onto my legs. \"How Kickback get here?\" I asked myself, confusion enveloping my mind like a thick fog. All I could remember were two, large, one-eyed bots, and the pain I had just experienced. I looked at my servo, and my optics widened in shock. What I clearly remembered once being a five-fingered servo, was now a large, three-fingered one. I quickly walked over to a nearby desk with a glass panel on it, and looked into it. I saw my reflection, and it nearly startled me. My head now clearly had two, small, yellow antenna sticking out of the middle of it, and there were two, large, purple optics below them. I began to open my mouth, and I saw two, large mandibles part ways, showing off a mouthful of needle-sharp teeth. I turned my body around and looked at my back. I now had thin, membranous wings on my slightly hunched back, and there was a large, black-and-green, striped, insect-esque abdomen. I backed away at the sight, and looked at the closed door next to me. \"How Kickback ezzzcape from here?\" I nervously asked myself when I realized the door was locked. I hit it with my servo in frustration, not expecting anything to happen, when suddenly I felt little resistance as it made a hole. I stared at my the hole my fist made, with a mix of surprise and joy. \"Kickback... Not like Kickback anymore...\" I slowly began to say as I began to rip more pieces of the door apart. \"Kickback look like wazzzp\" I buzzed, thinking of my appearence. \"And Kickback also like... Like Terminator...\" I said again, in glee, thinking back to that movie I distinctly remember seeing. \"Kickback iz... Iz... Wazpinator!\" I shouted as I finished tearing the door down, laughing to myself. I turned my head left and right, and saw two directions I could head down. I turned to the right one and made a dash down it, only to slam into something that felt like a wall, knocking me to the ground. \"You!\" A familiar voice shouted, as I felt a servo grab my arm and lift me up. I tried to wriggle out of the titanic grip, and saw in horror that it was Lugnut \"You... Look different\" Lugnut growled as he held me up. I clawed at him and he immediately dropped me. He kicked me before I could get a good footing, punting me dozens of meters back where I landed on the ground. \"I was wrong to let Shockwave kill you slowly...\" He began as I reared up to my full height, which to say was only about half of his. \"...So I\"ll have to kill you now!\" He shouted as he charged at me. Raising his arm to smash his fist into me, I dodged by jumping back, and, wings buzzing, I flew over him before he could react. As I landed on the ground, he turned to me, his single optic glowing red in rage. \"After I\"m done with you, I can\"t wait to see the looks on your filthy Autobot friend\"s faces when I show them your head, before I destroy them too\" he said, a small chuckle escaping from his jaw. I could feel my expression changed from one of worry, to anger. \"You... You think you can hurt Wazpinator\"s friends?\" I shouted. \"Then... Wazpinator hurt you!\" I could feel my T-cog shift as I transformed, a new feeling overtaking me as it completed. My vision became more acute, and I noticed that Lugnut appeared to glow orange, as if I was using thermal vision. I felt something shift out of my abdomen, and I saw it was a long, barbed stinger, dripping a clear, liquid poison most foul. \"Wazpinator hurt you!\" I screamed again as I flew to him, stinger raised and ready to impale him."]}

The second we made it up the pathway, Winry was up on the upper balcony berating Nii-san for once again damaging the automail she\"d made. A flying wrench and few insults later, Auntie Pinako ushered us inside. It was good to be home. Since it was mid-day and still a few hours until dinner, Winry insisted that she was going to start the repairs on Nii-san\"s arm. I passed the time helping Auntie around the house; doing little things like chopping firewood or moving heavier boxes around. In the background, I could hear the usual exchange between Nii-san and Winry. She blamed him for the damage to her automail. He retorted that he paid for it; therefore it was his to damage. And back and forth it went- just like always until Winry had finished the work and Nii-san had fallen asleep to let the pain of the nerve-endings ebb away. Curious as to how Nii-san was fairing and hoping to talk to Winry as well, I\"d gone to knock on the door. It was already open, my metal fist poised to knock just edging the cracked door open further. And that\"s when I saw her, sitting by Nii-san and... \"Al!\" She started, jumping up from the couch. She\"d noticed me and I had a feeling that I had just intruded onto something I shouldn\"t have. Slowly, she crossed the room; muttering to herself and probably wishing she\"d shut the door better. I waited until she\"d come out and shut the door behind her before I spoke. Choosing my words carefully, I glanced to the door behind her. \"Winry, has something... changed?\" She blinked, obviously trying to gauge what I meant, \"Changed?\" \"Between you and Nii-san.\" Blue eyes widened at that and I noticed her trying to hide her blush. \"No- I mean- what would make you think that, Al?\" \"I saw. You... you kissed him on the forehead while he was sleeping, didn\"t you?\" Winry grimaced, turning a brighter shade of red. Despite everything we\"d all been through, we were all just children at heart. She started to fidget and I couldn\"t hold back any longer. Reaching out, I placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. \"It\"s okay, Winry. I guess you could say I approve.\" \"Al...\" I hung my head in thought, \"Father and Mother aren\"t here anymore, and I know I\"m the younger brother so I really haven\"t much a say in the matter, but- take good care of him, Winry.\" I felt her arms attempt to wrap around the torso of the armor as best as she could. The distance between us, that awkward something- was now open armed acceptance. It was all suddenly so clear; that she loved him, that she didn\"t want to hurt my feelings if she picked him over me, that she had perhaps even just realized these feelings herself. \"Idiot,\" Her voice cut into my thoughts, \"Stop trying to act so grown up. We\"ll both look out for Ed; he needs all the help he can get.\" I laughed at that, echoing inside the armor as I did, \"Nii-san does get into more trouble than most.\" \"But...thank you, Al. To know you approve, well, it means a lot.\" I hugged her tighter, this girl who had always been like a sister to me. \"Let\"s just hope Nii-san will get a clue soon, right?\" \"Get a clue about what?\" Nii-san\"s voice interrupted in as he peered out from the doorway. Luckily, gauging by his sleepy expression, he\"d not heard much. But I had to admit, he did look slightly irked that Winry was still hugging me. I smirked inwardly; glad to see that at least on some subconscious level he had realized how strong his feelings for our childhood friend were. \"You\"ll figure it out, Nii-san,\" I replied, wishing I could give Winry a wink to tell her that this was our little secret for now. But she understood anyways, turning to face him with her hands planted firmly on her hips. \"Oh yes, I\"m sure the great and wonderful Edward Elric, alchemy freak, has many books to study on this matter,\" She said sarcastically, practically laughing. \"Hey! What are you talking about?\" Winry tapped him on the nose, \"It\"s a secret.\" Then without a word more, she left him dumbfounded in her wake as she headed towards the kitchen. \"What was that about?\" He asked me. I shook my head. Alchemy might be one thing, but when it came to romance- sometimes he could be a bit slow. \"Nothing. Let\"s go, dinner should be ready.\" Nii-san stretched then, testing the joints of his new arm. As we headed towards the kitchen, I saw a little bit of his \"intelligence\" slip through. \"Winry\"s sure something else, isn\"t she?\" I smiled, \"Maybe next time, you should tell that to her.\" He snorted at the idea, as if such a thing would never happen anytime soon. But inwardly I knew- it might not be too long before it did. \"Oi, Granny- why do I have to fix this again?\" Pinako paused where she was sweeping on the back porch and glanced up at the young man, \"Perhaps Winry should ask the same of your automail, hmm?\" Ed winced, grinning sheepishly, \"Aw, come on. I didn\"t wreck it this time!\" \"This time, he says...\" She thought to herself. \"Listen here boy, Winry\"s working hard to get your leg done while she\"s here in town. You know she\"s busy with all the business she\"s been getting in Rush Valley, so coming here to make your adjustments is a favor. Understand that?\" He nodded, not wanting to explain why he insisted on having her come here. It was better if she was blissfully unaware that she could be being watched. Either way, he still felt somewhat safer from the prying eyes of the homunculi when he was back in Risenpool. And if he felt safer, then Winry surely was as well. Pinako had welcomed the two boys home that morning, and before Ed could even remotely digest his breakfast- he\"d been ushered out back to repair the fence. And so, he\"d been there most of the day- only getting a brief change of scenery mid-morning when Winry arrived and drug him inside long enough to pry his leg off and give him a temporary one to use while she adjusted his. \"She could have at least said more than a \"hello, here- let me take that- blah blah blah\"...\" Ed muttered to himself, taking his frustrations out on the wooden fence. Much to his dismay, Pinako had overheard him, \"If someone hadn\"t given her such a pressing deadline to meet, then she could talk longer.\" Repressing a retort, he gathered up another pile of the fence\"s rotting wood and transmuted it back into the wooden beams it once was. Only about ten sections left. The morning passed and the sun had peaked noon at least a few hours before. As for the fence, Ed had just finished transmuting the last beam back into place; pausing beside one beam, he knelt and inspected it. \"Heh...so it\"s not there anymore, eh? I guess it got repaired as well...\" Smiling sadly to himself, Ed sighed. Despite all the work he\"d done- it wasn\"t identical to the way the fence once was. \"Something wrong, Nii-san?\" Al asked, coming around the side of the house. Ed shook his head as he pulled his hand away from the wooden post, \"Ah Al, you done chopping wood for the midget hag?\" \"I heard that!\" Pinako\"s voice boomed from inside the house. Ed shuddered. \"How does she do that?\" Al shrugged, \"I think it\"s Mother-thing. Remember? Mother used to tell us she could see with eyes on the back of her head.\" \"I guess...\" \"So what\"s wrong with the beam?\" Al questioned, still curious about the somber expression he\"d seen Ed with before. \"N-Nothing...\" Ed stammered, starting to walk towards the house. Al waited until Ed was inside, knowing that the creaks of the suit would give his movement away. But once he was certain he was out of earshot, he looked over to the wooden fence. \"Wait, is this where...?\" He murmured thoughtfully. Then, smiling as best he could with the armor, his eyes drifted towards the house, \"Ahhh, so that\"s why...\" After supper, Winry had gotten Ed\"s adjusted automail reattached and as usual, Ed had fallen asleep not long after. Even if it was just his leg, the entire experience of having the nerves reconnected- combined with his labor on the fence- was enough to make him exhausted. And as usual, Al found Winry seated not too far from where Ed had fallen asleep on the bench. \"Nii-san fixed the fences today...\" Al began tentatively. Part of him felt like it wasn\"t his place to intrude on what was seemingly Edward and Winry\"s ground; but at the same time, he was afraid that neither of them would do anything about it. \"Ah, so Granny finally got him to do that. They were beginning to look like nothing but mulch...\" Winry shrugged. Almost thankful that his armored exterior wouldn\"t show his apprehension, Al looked down at his sleeping brother. \"He seemed a bit sad. Something about the fifth fence post didn\"t get fixed, I guess...\" As he\"d expected, Winry seemed to perk up a bit at the mention. Her eyes darted from Ed to the wall of the house that shielded that very fence from her view. Finally, she murmured her reply. \"He remembered...\" \"What\"s that, Winry?\" Al asked, not expecting her to truly answer him. \"It was the fifth one on the right, just outside the backdoor...right?\" She queried. Al nodded, \"I\"m pretty sure that was the one. But I\"m sure Nii-san would show you once he\"s awake.\" \"No-no there\"s no need to...\" She trailed off, seeming to catch a glint in the eye of the suit of armor that most wouldn\"t perceive. Winry shook her head then, eyes shifting to Ed once again. \"Perhaps...perhaps I will ask him to show me.\" Gently, Al patted her on the shoulder, \"I think that\"ll make Nii-san feel a lot better, Winry.\" \"Winry...\" Ed practically whined, \"Where are you taking me? I\"m half-awake!\" The sun was barely peering over the horizon and the stars were just about done fading away. The morning dew made the grass damp, and Ed grumbled under his breath about stupid mechanics and their stupid need to get him up so early. \"To visit a memory,\" She\"d replied cryptically, walking the precise amount of paces out of the back door and to the right. Ed\"s eyes widened as he realized where she was taking him. \"Winry...why are we...\" She reached up and placed a finger over his lips to silence him. \"I knew Granny was going to have you fix it, but it wasn\"t until Al mentioned it that I realized what fixing it might repair.\" Ed blushed, muttering to himself and glancing away. \"Yah well... I guess I had to fix it sooner or later. I mean, I was the one who broke it.\" Winry laughed to herself, hiding her own blush. \"Well, that\"s not all...right?\" Shyly the two met each others eyes, and without a word, they knew the other remembered. This was the fence post Ed had broken when he was younger. A childish game that ended in blood and tears. And, as they both seemed to recall well, a get-well-soon kiss. -----------------------\"Here- Momma always did this for me and it stopped hurting right away!\"\"Really?\"\"Uh-huh. It\"s like magic!\"Ed\"s golden eyes widened, drawn in by the thought of anything magic-like being held in such a simple action.But sure enough, once Winry kissed his cheek, he\"d forgotten all about his bloody leg and the splinters in it. The two teenagers fell silent, both reflecting on that day from years before. It would be silly of them to pretend it never had happened, but admitting it had wasn\"t any easier. After a moment, and letting a dash of impulsive thought take the lead, they both spoke up. \"Winry...\" \"Ed...\" \"I...err...\" \"I...err...\" \"You go first.\" \"You go first.\" They both glanced away at that, trying to muster the nerve to continue. It was Winry to make the first move, edging closer to Ed and pressing a chaste kiss to his cheek. \"F-for your leg, so it\"ll get better soon,\" She murmured; a cover she knew Ed would see right through. His face turned red, his throat going dry as he looked towards her. Embarrassment getting the best of them, Winry was slowly starting for the back door- a safe retreat- but a firm grasp on her wrist halted her steps. \"Winry...I...\" He gently tugged her closer, his mind absently noting that the sun was rising behind her. Subconsciously, he noted how beautiful she looked like this; but consciously, he was preoccupied with attempting to get words out of his mouth. In the end, like most everything else he did, Edward let his impulsiveness guide him. And it wasn\"t until his lips were pressed against hers that he realized perhaps he shouldn\"t do everything on his brash impulse. Pulling back, and blushing profusely, Ed countered Winry\"s lame cover with one of his own. \"T-take care, Winry.\" She smiled, her face just as equally reddened. \"You too, Ed.\" From the crack of the backdoor, six eyes watched and the three sighed in relief. Pinako shook her head and headed towards the kitchen to fix breakfast; muttering to herself that was about time they got a clue. Den, on sensing that food was about to be cooked, turned tail and followed. This left Al, who was inwardly grinning like an idiot and he knew it. Now, to get away from the door before they came back in... \"Al!\" Ed\"s voice caught him, and with a clang Al hit into the doorframe out of surprise. Winry just blushed and covered her face, an action that Ed soon mimicked. \"Don\"t you tell anyone about this, Al. Brother\"s honor!\" Al nodded, trying hard not to laugh. \"O-okay, I promise.\" \"Swear it!\" \"I swear it.\" Ed \"hmphed\" to himself, as if that settled things and began to walk back inside. Momentarily, he paused and looked back to Winry. \"Winry, come on. Breakfast.\" She frowned, figuring that Ed would try and continue like nothing had changed. Sighing in resignation, she followed him in. \"All right, all right.\" But the second the two both tried to cram through the doorway at the same time- instead of the usual curses and arguments, they found themselves spluttering \"I\"m sorrys\" and blushing a lot. They still had time to get everything sorted out, Al concluded as he watched them awkwardly interacting over breakfast; but until then- he figured that this was at least a good start. The car continued on in silence, the two remaining passengers both thinking over the situation at hand. It had become a treacherous web of deceit, lies and blackmail. The Fuhrer held all the cards in his hands now, and he knew each and every weakness to exploit. For the Flame Alchemist, he held the cards of his loyal subordinates; now scattered to the winds aside from the most precious card which he would hold close at hand. For the Fullmetal Alchemist, he held the threat of harm to a girl named Winry Rockbell; knowledge of her location a dangerous warning to the boy. But this was not the time to give up or back down, Roy Mustang assured himself. As Major Armstrong had said only moments before in that very car- this too was a battlefield and none of them planned to run away with their tails between their legs. Thinking back to the brief words he\"d exchanged with the elder Elric brother on exiting the Fuhrer\"s office, Roy realized there was one more thing he should confirm before going back. \"First Lieutenant, I think I\"ll be taking the car from here.\" The blonde haired woman glanced up, \"Colonel?\" \"Following up on a loan I\"ve made with one of our shorter alchemists.\" Riza smiled, easily reading into the man\"s words. \"We\"re almost to my apartment. You can take it from there.\" \"I can come by later tonight, if you\"d like,\" Roy casually remarked, rubbing the back of his head. \"There\"s no need to worry about me, Colonel. I can take care of myself.\" \"Ah... there was more than just concern in that proposition,\" He sulked. \"But...\" Riza paused as she turned onto her street, \"If you need to call, I\"m sure Elizabeth will be available.\" Roy smiled at the alias that had become a small joke between the two. But Riza was right; a rendezvous the night before she officially became the Fuhrer\"s secretary would be rather suspicious. And right now, he knew he couldn\"t take a single risk with Riza\"s safety hanging in the balance. \"Ahh Elizabeth, how I do love talking to her,\" He murmured, glancing out the window as they pulled to a stop, \"She\"s a very beautiful and charming woman, you know.\" Riza paused a moment as she stepped out of the car; a smile creeping onto her features as Roy turned to look at her. \"I\"ll have to tell her that you have such an appreciation of her, Colonel.\" \"More than I think she knows, First Lieutenant,\" He replied, expression turning serious, \"Be careful.\" \"I should be saying that to you.\" He caught her hand before the car door closed, \"We\"ll both be careful then.\" \"Of course.\" Roy gave her hand a reassuring squeeze as she let go and headed for the door. His eyes swept the area, still on edge at the Fuhrer\"s knowledge of the girl in Rush Valley and afraid of what surveillance he had within Central itself. \"Every movement could be watched so easily around here. I suppose I\"ll have to be cautious if I want to talk with Fullmetal without arousing suspicion...\" The area of town behind the eldest Elric looked brand new, namely because- it mostly was. After fixing up all the damage caused during his battle with Scar, Edward was downright exhausted. The last veranda back in pristine, albeit slightly more gothic architecturally, condition- he was glad to be headed back towards the hotel and a soft bed. His mind still pondering the facets of alchemy, Edward didn\"t hear the car pulling up beside him until the familiar voice called out. \"You shouldn\"t be wandering around like this with Scar still on the loose, Fullmetal.\" Ed started, turning to glare at the man seated in the car, \"Colonel. If you\"re here to help me clean up- you\"re too late. I had to do it all by myself, thank you very much.\" \"Very responsible of you to clean up your own mess.\" The two glared at each other for a moment before Roy gestured to the unoccupied passenger\"s seat. \"Get in; I\"ll take you to your hotel.\" Raising an eyebrow, Edward realized this was more than just a kindly offer and that the other alchemist wanted to talk in private. \"I suppose since Scar is still out there, it would be safer for me to travel by car,\" Ed announced loud enough for the military people nearby to overhear. \"Might be a good idea, Fullmetal.\" Clambering into the vehicle, Ed and Roy drove in silence until they were well away from any of the military officers still checking the area for Scar\"s whereabouts. Roy glanced about once more to assure that they weren\"t being followed or watched before starting up a conversation. \"Tired?\" \"What do you think?\" Edward shot back, slumping down further in the seat. Roy knew the day had to have been stressful on the teenage boy, but at the same time- he needed to make sure that for the moment everyone was safe. Although, as he rightfully presumed, talking anything hinting at romance with Edward Elric was not always easy. \"I think 520 cenz is just the right amount of a loan for a phone call. Hmm?\" \"Tch! That\"s none of your business...\" Roy shrugged, \"It was my money that paid for it, I should know what the money went for- don\"t you think?\" Edward sulked for a moment, realizing that if he didn\"t crack that Roy would surely reason that answering his question was only equivalent trade for him loaning the money. Thinking back to his phone call to Rush Valley, Ed frowned once again on not quite understanding Winry\"s reaction. \"Colonel...\" He started; still not sure he wanted to ask Colonel Mustang, of all people, for advice on women. \"Hmm?\" \"Is it normal for girls to get mad at you for being worried?\" Edward coughed lightly, trying to appear casual as he looked out the window and hoped his question wasn\"t a stupid one. Roy just smiled, shaking his head, \"I take it she\"s all right then?\" \"...Yah. Though apparently I\"m creepy for calling to check on her,\" Ed muttered in reply. \"Consider that a sign that you need to be nice to her more often, Fullmetal.\" \"Whatever.\" Frowning as another concern flooded into his mind, Roy turned left- the long way to the hotel- and posed another question. \"Did anyone see you place the call?\" Edward\"s face fell serious. \"It\"s desperate moments like this that let you get taken advantage of.\" Greed\"s words, coming from Ling\"s voice, echoed inside his mind. Roy\"s eyes widened as he realized that someone did indeed see it, already trying to think and plan a way to assure that person\"s silence- if it wasn\"t too late already. \"Fullmetal?\" Grimacing as he thought back to it, Ed recounted the situation. \"Ling...no- Greed overheard.\" Roy\"s expression darkened, \"So that\"s what the Fuhrer meant.\" \"The Fuhrer?\" \"Before you came to the room, he casually mentioned that he had strong Xing ally amongst his people now. So the boy has been made into a...\" \"He accepted it on his own, in hopes of gaining immortality,\" Ed explained. The car fell silent as the grim words weighed down on them. Thinking back to his encounters with this new Greed, Edward\"s face brightened a little as he forgot one important thing to pass on to the Colonel. \"But, I wouldn\"t worry about him telling the Fuhrer I called Winry.\" \"Why\"s that?\" \"Ling\"s still in there, still conscious of Greed\"s actions.\" \"What?\" Roy asked in shock. \"When I first fought him, he dropped his guard when I mentioned Ran Fan. And when he saw Al and I at the phone booth, he approached us to deliver her a message on Ling\"s behalf.\" \"And this message was?\" \"Something he\"d written out, I couldn\"t read it since it was in Xingese. But he thanked us for the favor, so I doubt he\"ll do anything to harm us for now. As for Ran Fan, Ling won\"t let her down.\" \"Won\"t let her down, hmm?\" Roy thought to himself, glad to hear that even if he was now tangled up with the homunculi, the Xing boy was in a position to relate with their problems.", "\"I was just wondering- what do you consider perfection?\" He expected a shrug, then a vague answer or perhaps the name of a perfected jutsu or food dish. Instead, Itachi stood abruptly; hesitating a brief moment before crossing the room. Kisame felt the lean figure press up against him and couldn\"t help but grin. Trying to distract me so you don\"t have to answer, eh? The black and red cloak pooled at his feet, pale fingers sliding the garment from the broad shoulders. Fabric rustled, all of it becoming a forgotten heap on the floor. Giving in to the distraction, Kisame pushed Itachi back unto the futon. \"Rather creative way to avoid answering me, Itachi-san...\" He gruffly whispered as he pressed a kiss to the slender neck of the shorter man. Itachi\"s usual frown deepened in thought and his eyebrows furrowed. What do I consider perfection? He ran the question through his mind as his red eyes danced over the light cerulean body above him. \"Blue...\" Itachi murmured, more to himself than to Kisame; the color pinpointing the instinctive answer. \"What?\" Kisame paused in trailing rough kisses down Itachi\"s bare chest at hearing the rather silent, stoic man speak. \"Your answer,\" He explained. My answer is...blue? Kisame tried to find the relevance, as he observed Itachi\"s dark eyes for any clues. To that which is perfect- few things can be viewed as more ideal. The only thing to which perfection concedes is that which brings them to their knees; the one thing that can subdue them- their weakness in its truest form. Itachi viewed emotions- love, desire, passion- as a weakness. Itachi was someone who couldn\"t be stopped or subdued. Itachi never got on his knees for anyone- except... Kisame\"s eyes widened. Perfect...blue. \"You mean...\" Itachi nodded, his face remaining inexpressive. Uchiha Itachi was perfection, but the quintessential truth lay beside him. The one thing even perfection bowed to- both physically and emotionally... ...was a blue-skinned man named Hoshigaki Kisame. THE END Author\"s Notes: Here\"s my second one for these guys... T itle : Red and Black Pairing : Hoshigaki Kisame/Uchiha Itachi Fandom : Naruto Theme : #1/Look Over Here Disclaimer : \"Naruto\" is copyright Masashi Kishimoto. Notes: Takes place directly post episode 85 \"Neh, Itachi-san?\" He turned to face his partner, black hair brushing against blue skin. The slight motion was enough though for Kisame to acknowledge that Itachi was listening. \"How long will it be until your sharingan comes back?\" Itachi frowned; it wasn\"t often that he had to exert so much energy in one day. Honestly, he wasn\"t sure. \"I\"ll need to continue to rest,\" He stated simply. Kisame nodded, gently untying the forehead protector from Itachi\"s head and sitting it aside. \"Stupid brat, causing so much trouble; now we have no choice but to lay around and do nothing the rest of the day.\" Their cloaks had already been discarded by the door; their current lodgings far enough from Konoha that no one would find them, yet not so far that they wore themselves out further getting there. Laying besides each other on the futon, they just relished the peace and quiet along with each other\"s company. \"Do you remember the day we met?\" Kisame questioned, not really expecting an answer. \"It was humid then,\" Itachi replied after a moment. \"Yah, just like it is today...\" The warm weather weighted down on the black-cloaked men, all having gathered together to induct a new member into their ranks and to assign him his partner. Now, with the formalities over, only a few members remained- most having gone back to their current missions or posts. \"Hmm. So that\"s my assigned partner?\" Kisame\"s eyes danced over the shorter, cloaked man, \"He\"s rather...thin.\" A cold laugh emanated from beside him, \"It\"s a very healthy body. Very...powerful.\" Slitted-eyes perused the younger man, plots and plans running through his mind. \"Orochimaru-san,\" Kisame intervened, beginning to walk towards the new member, \"He\"s my partner, so don\"t make him into part of your body collection.\" The pale-skinned man shrugged, \"You couldn\"t defend him if I wanted to.\" But Kisame called his bluff, \"I\"m sure he can defend himself, Orochimaru-san.\" Nearing the place where the black-haired man sat, Kisame kept his distance. Close enough to observe, far enough away not to be noticed immediately. He knew the man\"s stats- but Kisame was also a firm believer in only believing things that he\"d seen with his own two eyes. And that just happened to be the particular body part that he really wanted to see on the other man. Come on, look over here... They were supposed to be blood red, crimson red, hellfire red. Some rumors even said that the Uchiha had bathed his eyes in the blood of his clan to give them such a blood-stained appearance. All the stats, all the stories, all the rumors- made the eyes sound like a horror to behold, a truly terrifying experience. Sensing the presence behind him, Itachi glanced up; his red eyes locking with the simple black pupils of Kisame. There were many words that came to the blue-skinned man\"s mind that moment, but none of them were harsh or threatening in any way. Those eyes were powerful, strong... beautiful. \"Hoshigaki Kisame, formerly of the Mist Seven. Am I correct?\" He grinned at the acknowledgement, \"It looks like you\"re familiar with me already- Uchiha Itachi.\" \"Kisame. Look over here.\" Itachi\"s voice was smooth, yet stoic and it jarred Kisame from his memories. \"Ah Itachi-san, what is it?\" The blue-skinned man watched in silence as the Itachi reached up and removed the forehead protector from where it rested against his temple, tossing it onto the table with his own. \"You should appreciate it while you can.\" Some people would assume he meant the tranquil moment they were indulging it. Others might guess that if the Uchiha did have any semblance of a heart- that he meant for his partner to enjoy their time alone together, these being the only times they were allowed to have loving emotions of any sort. But Kisame knew what he truly meant, his black eyes meeting with the rare sight of another set of black eyes. Leaning forward to kiss Itachi\"s forehead, he pushed the stray strands of hair from the other man\"s face. \"It\"s the first time I\"ve got to see them like this.\" \"It\"s as they say,\" Itachi responded. \"There\"s a first time for everything?\" Itachi nodded, nonchalantly resting his head against Kisame\"s chest. \"Rest, Itachi-san,\" He said closing his own eyes to rest, \"Seeing them once is enough for me.\" The road into village, as usual, was covered by mist; that was after all what the village had gotten its name from. But in these late hours of the evening, the mist was more like a blanket over the ground- tucking it in for the night. Crossing the bridge at this unusual hour, were two cloaked figures conversing casually. Well to be precise, the taller was speaking and the other seemed to be listening. \"When I was a kid, I used to play on this bridge all the time,\" The blue-skinned man reminisced, thinking back to his youthful days in his home village. Pointing to a dark splotch on the landscape ahead of him, Kisame continued. \"And that forest is where I killed my first nin while on a mission.\" The bridge creaked in the light winds as they set foot on the ground on the other side, Kisame\"s face lighting up with a wide grin. \"This is the road that led to my home, Itachi-san. It hasn\"t changed at all.\" Crimson eyes glanced out at the simple village and the adjoining forests and waterways, his gaze then turning to his partner. \"It seems rather pointless to appreciate a home you\"ve left,\" He muttered, thinking back to his own decimated village- littered with the bodies of the Uchiha clan. \"I\"m appreciating the memories I have here, not the location itself, Itachi-san,\" Kisame corrected, thinking over all the places he had fond recollections of. \"So one must first have a pleasant memory of a place to enjoy it?\" Thinking that over, an idea pricked at Kisame\"s mind. \"Perhaps we shall find out.\" Using Kisame\"s familiarity with the village to their advantage, they were able to secure an obscure lodging location for the night. But much to Itachi\"s dismay, said place only had a single-bed room available due to water-damage in some of the other rooms. Assuring his partner that they\"d make do somehow, Kisame led Itachi down the hall to their room. \"I\"ve never stayed at this hotel before, but I\"ve heard it\"s fairly low-key,\" He said under his breath as he unlocked the door. Itachi nodded in acknowledgement; his frown deepening at the state of the accommodations. \"I can see why.\" Kisame gave an awkward grin as he surveyed the room, \"Not the best on the upkeep, are they?\" Itachi began to sit his cloak on a dusty chair, but thought better of it. \"I\"m going to sleep,\" He stated simply, moving towards the bed. \"Then I\"ll sleep with you,\" Kisame replied. Itachi\"s eyes widened slightly and he fixed his partner with a questioning gaze. Kisame, on the other hand, looked equally shocked at his own words. \"Well, sure I\"d been thinking it but...\" He laughed inwardly, \"I suppose being back home just put me so at ease it slipped out.\" Sensing a distinctive glare on him, the blue-skinned man sighed and tried to explain himself. \"Itachi-san, you said one must first have a pleasant memory of a place to enjoy it, right?\" The red-eyes softened in intensity, Itachi\"s deadpan expression shifted from slightly shocked and confused (if you squinted really hard) to slightly expectant and hopeful (if you tilted your head just right.) Kisame paused, trying to form the right words- wanting it to be something that would say all he needed to in a way Itachi would understand. Well, Itachi-san does rather prefer things to be straightforward and without lots of excess information... Sitting down beside the black-haired man on the bed, Kisame gave him one last nervous smile before taking the plunge. His battle-scarred hand cautiously reached up to rest against Itachi\"s cheek and his eyes locked on the crimson eyes before him- searching them for anything that might indicate an emotion. But at the moment, Kisame was getting mixed messages from his partner. On the outside, Itachi seemed to be saying \"What the hell do you think you\"re doing?\" but when you looked past that fa\u00e7ade, you could see that there was an eighteen year old young man underneath waiting for his companion\"s lips to capture his own. Hoping that his instincts about Itachi\"s inner thoughts were right, Kisame did just that- pressing his lips against Itachi\"s in a chaste kiss. Pulling back, and expecting to find a kunai or something else stabbing him for what he\"d done- Kisame was surprised to see that Itachi was just...staring at him. \"What was that supposed to be?\" Itachi asked; voice cold and mechanical. \"Um...a question?\" Kisame said tentatively, then on still not seeing any signs of irritation or anger, he clarified, \"It was a question. I know you prefer actions over words, Itachi-san.\" The black-haired man looked perplexed for a moment, raising a hand to rest against his lips in thought. He stayed like that for several minutes, until finally- it seemed that he\"d given up on trying to find an answer. \"I\"m going to sleep.\" Kisame sighed, glad that he wasn\"t dead for trying something as brash as kissing Uchiha Itachi, but somewhat disappointed in the reaction. \"We have a mission to attend to tomorrow,\" Itachi continued, lying down on one side of the bed. \"I know...\" Kisame murmured, his disappointment showing more than he would have liked it to. He started to get up, figuring that he\"d just find a place to lean up against the dirty hotel walls and hopefully sleep that way. But as he moved to stand, Itachi\"s unusual talkative streak spoke up once more. \"The bed. It... isn\"t that small.\" Kisame looked between his partner and the small bed he laid on. Not wanting to impose himself more than he already had- but not wanting to sleep on the floor unless he absolutely had to; Kisame sat on the bed, leaning up against the headboard as he stretched his legs out. \"I\"ll keep an eye out for any suspicious activity. You sleep, Itachi-san.\" That reasoning seemed to be enough for Itachi, and he rolled to his side and closed his eyes. Looking to where the samehada rested beside him, Kisame took a deep breath- enjoying the distinct smell of the Mist village air. He might have been sitting to one edge of a rather small bed, its poor springs and mattress strained with the weight of two occupants, while Itachi slept beside him- but it all seemed rather....pleasant. \"So one must first have a pleasant memory of a place to enjoy it?\" Itachi\"s comment seemed to echo in his mind, and Kisame smiled to himself. The road back home for a missing-nin was never easy, but this time- Kisame reasoned- the memories he would have of this night in his home town would stay with him forever. Continued in the next chapter This was not the way Itachi liked things to be. It was unsettling, unnatural, unnerving. Something had gone wrong, but then again, he was trained to know that things never went as planned. It was just a rare fluke that the one change in the plans left him in such a state. Sure, his opponents never knew that they\"d gotten a shot in. He never let them know, and those that did figure it out didn\"t live to take advantage of it. Part of him wanted to blame the heat. Or the fact he hadn\"t slept well the night before due to a midnight raid on their location. But the more he thought it over; it all came down to one simple distraction. Kisame. His crimson eyes searched the area for the blue-skinned man; but he was nowhere in sight. A new Mist-Seven. Is it possible they knew of him since he was a former member? Wincing, he glared at the injury on his side- the kunai still protruding out from it. Then again. It seemed they had some knowledge of my fighting techniques as well. Yanking out the kunai and throwing it absently atop the dead bodies piled nearby, Itachi attempted to stand, only to realize that perhaps he was a little more exhausted than it first seemed. \"Kisame?\" He said quietly, eyes scanning the area once again for his companion. A rustle of leaves drew his attention, but the cause of it only warranted a kunai in the throat. As the last of the Mist-nin group fell, Itachi straightened his stance and began to walk towards the direction he\"d last seen Kisame in. Having finished off the last of the nins that he\"d lured away from Itachi, Kisame tallied up the bodies and shrugged. \"My, they sure came prepared when they heard we were in town for business. A new Mist-Seven and this many nins? Oi...Itachi-san, we can go on ahead now. The path\"s clear.\" He waited for the reply coming from where he\"d left the Uchiha back in the forest, but there was no response. \"Itachi-san?\" Swinging the samehada over his shoulder, he quickly headed towards where he\"d last seen Itachi. Passing countless bodies and waylaid weapons lodged into the trees, Kisame frowned as a blur of red and black caught his eyes. It was Itachi\"s cloak all right, but it was torn and bloody- and that didn\"t sit well with him at all. Reaching down, he cradled the cloak in his arms. \"Itachi-san?\" He called once more. Following the trail of blood with his eyes, he saw his partner resting against a nearby tree. Itachi glanced up as if nothing was out of the ordinary, not the type to even let his closest companion see his weaknesses. \"Did you finish the others off?\" \"Itachi-san, what about...\" \"Then we need to move on ahead and finish off the target.\" The black-haired man stood, making a motion as if to snatch his cloak out of Kisame\"s arms. But instead of taking back his tattered cloak and putting it on like he\"d planned; Itachi fell forward as his mind went momentarily blank. Itachi wasn\"t sure exactly what had happened, but when he registered his surroundings, he found that he was cradled in Kisame\"s arms. \"Ah Itachi-san, are you all right?\" His eyes narrowed in thought as he tried to piece together what had happened. \"You must have lost too much blood, Itachi-san. It\"s not like you to fall like that.\" Itachi regarded that comment, thinking back to the fight he\"d endured. Yes, he had sustained several minor injures and due to the numerable amounts of Mist-nin that they\"d had to fight off; those minor scraps had been bleeding for probably close to thirty minutes. Even he couldn\"t keep clear-headed with that much blood-loss. \"I suppose I was careless,\" He replied, once again thinking back to the one thing that had been distracting him throughout the fight. Kisame, was that your true intent last night? That kiss, those...feelings? His partner smiled his toothy grin as he held the Uchiha closer to his chest. \"Was something distracting you?\" Itachi raised a questioning gaze to meet Kisame\"s eyes. He knows. Or suspects. Or is just trying to drive me insane. Why was I distracted? Was I too preoccupied with the question I didn\"t answer and the man who asked it? \"I never answered your question.\" Kisame grinned, \"I\"m afraid you have, Itachi-san.\" A momentary glimpse into the youth behind the killer surfaced on Itachi\"s face, as the shock at Kisame\"s comment registered. Quickly hiding it with an irritated fa\u00e7ade- Itachi posed a question. \"And my answer was?\" \"How do you feel right now?\" Kisame countered with another question, grin still on his face. How do I feel? Itachi\"s eyebrows creased in thought. What did he feel? There he was, in the middle of the darkening forest, held in his partner\"s arms. One would think he would be rather irritable after the day he\"d had, but when Itachi paused to think about it- his mindset at that moment was quite the contrary. It was a feeling of contentment- not resentment. A moment of realization- not aggravation. There in the silence, cradled in Kisame\"s arms, all the answers he\"d ever needed his entire life flooded into his mind. Perfection. Destruction. Annihilation. Vengeance. Power. All the things he\"d ever sought never brought with them the satisfaction he\"d so desired to find. All his life, he\"d been searching for an unknown. But now, it looked like that \"unknown\" had found him. \"We should find a place to stay for the night,\" He replied, avoiding the question once more. \"Will another single bed suffice, Itachi-san?\" The dark-haired man frowned, knowing that Kisame was enjoying taunting him with the knowledge he now had in his possession. But when did I answer him? \"And to answer your question about when you answered...\" Kisame began, pausing a moment at the look on Itachi\"s face. Great, now he\"s reading my mind. Itachi\"s expression adjusted slightly and Kisame had to withhold a laugh at the slight pout he swore was forming. \"... Everyone knows how picky you are about your sleeping arrangements. The Leader\"s complained about your demands to have specific lodgings lined up for missions on numerous occasions. Itachi-san,\" He reached down and toyed absently with Itachi\"s ponytail, \"It was a one-person bed we shared.\" Furious at having all his walls of cold-heartedness stripped down so easily, Itachi glared viciously at a nearby tree to vent. \"Until those annoyances showed up, that is.\" Kisame\"s grin softened into a smile at that. They both had asked their questions, and now, they both had their answers. \"So single-bed room again, tonight?\" He dared ask. \"The Leader won\"t be pleased that we didn\"t take care of the target today,\" Itachi dodged. \"Heh, he can wait one more day,\" Kisame replied, standing with Itachi still cradled in his arms, \"First we need to get you bandaged. Tomorrow, there shouldn\"t be anymore distractions. Right, Itachi-san?\" Itachi looked up at the blue-skinned man, carrying him easily along with his sword. \"I can walk on my own.\" Kisame shook his head, lowering Itachi to his feet and draping his shredded cloak around him. \"Itachi-san, I think you\"ll need a new cloak soon.\" \"Is there a reason you\"re practically uninjured?\" \"You fought all of the new Mist-Seven members at once while I just dealt with their pathetic excuse for backup. I guess they didn\"t think I was a threat compared to you.\" Writing it off once more at all the inane distractions of the day, Itachi began to walk forward along the path. There was simply no way he\"d be seen cradled in someone\"s arms like that. Even if... \"Itachi-san, if you really want me to- I don\"t mind carrying you.\" The dark-haired man frowned and glared in Kisame\"s direction. \"That won\"t be necessary.\" Laughing to himself, Kisame leaned down to give a quick kiss to Itachi\"s forehead. \"...And that wasn\"t necessary either,\" Itachi grumbled. \"Just making sure you haven\"t changed your answer, Itachi-san.\" Snatching up his waylaid straw hat, Itachi pulled it on his head, the bells jingling at the abrupt movement. \"It\"s getting late.\" Kisame smiled, reaching down to pick up his own hat as he left Itachi to his thoughts. As the two headed towards the nearest town, the black-haired man sorted out all the questions and answers into the simplest of terms. To be carried, cradled or otherwise held in another man\"s arms; isn\"t a position you want to be seen in, even if you find it enjoyable. And anyone witnessing you sharing a bed with someone should never live to tell. It\"s foolish to cling to such unnecessary things as emotions. But you- you make it so easy to be a fool like that, Hoshigaki Kisame."]}
{"id": "d9d3fcf4-3af8-52d6-b83f-6c981a489284", "fandoms": ["Star Wars", "Ranma"], "pair": ["\"Your not coming are you?\" Leia said knowingly \"Your right I\"m not coming with you.\" Grace replied avoiding her eyes \"Why? so you can risk your life, get captured and tortured to try to save dad.\" Luke said \"Yes because he would do the same for us and both of you know it!\" Grace retorted \"Yes he would... so we must do the same.\" Luke said Both sibling\"s looked at their older sister with tears glistening in their eyes Grace hugged both of them and looked into their eyes \"Hey, we\"re always together in our heart\"s no matter what has happened.\" Grace said softly but sternly \"We know but its hard...\" Leia said but was interrupted \"You have to go.. now!\" Grace yelled as stormtroopers started to storm into the area as the transport flew away \"Don\"t worry we\"ll see each other soon\" Grace thought knowing her sibling\"s heard Grace grabbed the blaster from her boot and started to fire as fast as the blaster could allow but knew it wouldn\"t be enough. She ran as fast as she could but was blasted by as stun ray. The last thing she consciously heard was \" Inform the caption that we have a prisoner\" a stormtrooper said ~End Flashback~ Grace heard the door open and her mother was forced into the cell. \"How bad was it?\" Grace said referring to the whippings \"It hurt but I can handle it.\" Padme assured her daughter smiling weakly Grace knew she could but she knew it won\"t take long before she herself started to be given whippings and she couldn\"t help but feel sick. Here is my new story I have not decided on the name yet and George Lucas owns star wars not me but I own Grace Skywalker and Vader isn\"t in a suit. Both Padme and Grace received several whipping\"s to make them reveal where the rebels were but they failed to make them talk. Meanwhile with the emperor... \"Send medics to cell 6223 and make sure all the injuries are gone in a few weeks\" Palpatine Said \"Yes sir\" The emperor\"s com link beeped. \"Yes what is it\" growled Sidious \"The rebels on sollust are captured my master and being questioned.\" Said Vader \"Good after you destroy them return to Imperial center I have a surprise for you.\" Said sidious \"Yes master\" Vader said The comm. Shut off and the emperor smiled everything was going according to plan. Demoting Amidala was the best thing he ever did no one will question his authority now. Back with Padme and Grace two months later... Both Padme and were dressed in slave outfits that barely covered them and make up to cover wounds and whelps that haven\"t healed just yet and escorted by guards into the senate meeting room unseen by any of the senators. In celebration of his victory over a small group of rebels lord Vader and emperor Palpatine were in. Applause was heard throughout the senate hall. \"In honor of his victory I give him these gifts\" Said Palpatine Both Padme and Grace were kneeling in front of Vader. Whispers of \"senator Amidala\" and \"Grace Amidala\" were heard throughout the hall. \"Take them to my apartment\" Vader said. As he watched the guards led them away he thought. \"Why would he give me slaves given my horrible past?' Vader thought. When Vader entered his apartment he saw padme and Grace waiting \"What are your names\" Vader asked. \"Senator Padme Amidala\" Said Padme \"Grace Amidala\" Said Grace. \"Alright but since you\"re not a senator any more I will call you padme\" Vader said Padme ignored him. \"Well, this is going to be harder than I thought\" Vader and Grace thought \"Here are your bedrooms\" Vader said. The bedrooms were next to each other had their own refreshers. \"Thank you\" both Grace and Padme said. Then both of them took showers and got ready for bed and fell asleep except for Vader Vader couldn\"t understand why his master gave him slaves, he could see why he wanted to get rid of senator Amidala but why Grace she was barely fourteen by the looks of it and his master is probably on to something, but Vader is starting to suspect both the senator and Grace apart of his past. But he couldn\"t place it so he just let it go for now and so fell asleep. The next morning grace had woken up and went on the veranda and stared at the Coruscant sunrise feeling the breeze around her but she felt that her father was waking up so she hid up against the hallway wall and winced since a whelp on her back hasn\"t healed yet. Vader knew he heard either padme or Grace but decided to ignore which one it was and went on the veranda to meditate, and felt graces lingering presence, grace was on the veranda also behind him, he sensed. \"A little early isn\"t it?\" Vader asked turning to face Grace Grace shuttered as Vader\"s cold stare looked at her, it wasn\"t like the comforting stare she was used to from her father. Maybe, but I wanted to see the sunrise and look around, I guess.\" Grace said looking around the apartment \"Yes, well there are restrictions young one.\" Vader pointed out Grace felt her fathers force presence, it was full of darkness but she could feel a twinge of light. \"True, but neither my mother or I are used to our surroundings.\" Grace said while twirling a curl with her finger Vader could feel that she was nervous and chuckled seeing a 14 year old nervous around him, since he was used to people fearing him and being cowards around him. \"Well, lord Vader may I ask you something?\" grace asked Vader nodded wondering what she was going to say. \"How long have you worked for the emperor?\" grace asked \"For as long as I can remember.\" Vader answered \"So basically you\"ve been working for him for three years almost.' Grace thought with disgust \"Just wondering.\" Grace said turning around and walking back to her room for a little more sleep Grace slammed her bedroom door and slid down to the floor with her knees up and started to cry. \"My family\"s shattered. Since Luke and Leia are at the rendezvous point and Mom, Dad and I are here.' Grace thought while crying Vader heard the door slam and saw Padme come out and look at him \"What did you do.\" Padme wondered knowing that was her daughter \"Nothing.\" Vader said tersely \"You\"ve must have done something to upset her.\" Padme insisted \"Maybe the reality of being here is setting in.\" Vader suggested \"Possibly.\" Padme said knowing it\"ll take a few hours to get used to this Padme walked to her daughters room and knocked on the door \"Come in.\" Grace said her voice cracking slightly Padme walked in and saw her daughter sitting on the floor with tear stained cheeks and sat down next to her \"You alright?\" Padme asked Grace hesitated, sighing \"I\"m in between mom with everything that\"s happening.\" \"I know but you must try to be strong in this situation but you can talk with me when it gets hard.\" Padme said gently Meanwhile with Vader... It had been a while since Padme went into her daughters room and Vader was irritated \"Why does Grace\"s force signature feel so familiar and why she and her mother look so familiar?' Vader thought Vader searched his memory and came up empty except a image of him holding a beautiful baby girl and Padme sitting next to him. He decided to leave them alone for the day and tell them the guidelines the next morning. The next morning Grace and padme came into the kitchen and started to make breakfast but Vader was already making it so they just sat in the living room until he called them. \"You feeling better?\" Padme said softly Grace nodded trying to be strong but it\"s harder than before especially since darkness was surrounding her father with a glimmer of light. \"Breakfast.\" Yelled Vader Both Grace and her mom sat down at the table and started to eat. Alright, here are the rules no leaving the apartment at all unless its to go to the executor even then you will not leave the quarters.\" Vader instructed \"So... what are you going to do today\" Asked Padme. Grace was shocked her mom had barley said a word to her husband since they came into his care but she might warming up to Vader. \"I\"ll be checking on the plan for a battle station and then check on the army.\" Vader said walking towards the door Both Grace and padme nodded, And then he closed the door. Grace had made sure her mom wasn\"t looking so she crept into Vader\"s room and hacked into his computer and searched some files until she found something on her grandmother, Shmi. Grace read through the document that revealed that Palpatine paid some tusken raiders to kidnap her grandmother and basically beat her to death until her father came and to get a reaction that would start his plunge into the dark Side. \"Why?' thought Grace as she read through the document that contained the secret behind her grandma\"s kidnapping that led to her death. \"What are you doing?\" Asked padme. Then Grace turned and tried to hide the document but no dice. Padme gasped as she read the document and started to think. \"We can\"t tell Vader about this\" Said padme as she closed the documents on the computer. \"I know that Mom.\" Said Grace and then they turned off the computer and sat on the couch. Grace remembered after the announcement Obi-wan was horrified because he knew that was his best friend, brother and confidant, he thought he was gone but he wasn\"t, he thought it was a nightmare, Grace knew he was devastated but he would survive. It seemed like hours before Vader returned and Grace and Padme were nervous but they were prepared \"So what did you two do today?\" Asked Vader Grace\"s mouth was so dry she could barely speak but her mom came to her rescue as always \"We just watched some news.\" Padme said \"Alright I\"ll believe it for now.\" Vader said as he started to clean the dishes. Grace breathed a sigh of relief that her father didn\"t find out about the documents just yet. Later that night... Vader can\"t help but wonder where he had seen Padme and Grace before but couldn\"t remember but just then a flashback happened ~Flashback~ Vader saw himself in Jedi garb chasing a little girl with light brown curly hair who looked about three. \"You can\"t run from me little one!\" Anakin said confident Grace was running and giggling and didn\"t notice that her Daddy grab her and started to tickle her to death. When it stopped both landed on the couch still laughing \"Daddy can we pwease play pilot after dinner?\" Grace asked innocently after the laughing stopped \"I don\"t know baby girl it\"ll probably be time for bed after dinner.\" Anakin said seeing his wife giving him a look. \"Anakin I think that maybe after a bath you could play for 10 minutes\" Padme relented \"Alright, angel.\" Anakin said as he got up from the couch and placed their daughter on the couch safely and then kissed Padme Later after Grace went to sleep Anakin and Padme are laying in her bed in silence \"I wish you didn\"t have to go Ani.\" Padme says softly \"I know angel but I\"m sure I\"ll be back before you know it\" Anakin assures her \"Let\"s not think of tomorrow so my Jedi knight what\"s on the agenda tonight?\" Padme questioned \"Oh, I think you know\" Anakin whispered kissing her ~End Flashback~ Vader was confused if Grace and Padme were apart of his past as his daughter and wife, and his name was Anakin what did his past hold besides that was anything Palpatine the truth or was all of it a lie all along? Later that night Grace couldn\"t go to sleep so she went out on the balcony and looked at the stars because she misses Leia and Luke and she feels guilty about all the secret\"s she has kept for almost four years. She started to hum a lullaby that her mom and dad used to sing to her and Leia and Luke but turned to see Vader. \"What are you doing up?\" Vader asked \"I was just thinking of my parents and couldn\"t sleep.\" Grace said looking up at the stars \"Really? Cause I couldn\"t either\" Vader said \"Do you ever feel like there\"s something missing from your life?\" Grace questioned \"More and more each day it seems.\" Vader commented \"Too many secrets creep around you that it seems like its suffocating doesn\"t it.\" Grace said \"Maybe but if you tell someone you will feel better.\" Vader said Grace looked into her father\"s eye\"s and noticed he was being sincere \"I think it\"s time for bed little one.\" Vader suggested \"He still calls me little one after all these years even though I\"m not exactly little anymore\" Grace thought knowing her father heard Grace nodded and went back to bed while Vader was pretty sure he\"ll reveal himself as her father soon enough When Grace went back she went to her mother\"s room and got into bed with her like she did when she was little. Vader and Grace had several conversations over the next few days after that conversation... Grace woke up with a fever and was pale, and she felt like she was going to faint any minute she went into the kitchen to see Vader cooking breakfast for the three of them \"Good morning\" Grace said \"Good morning Grace.\" Vader said back Vader turned to see a very pale, tired teenager not the vibrant almost 14 year old he had come to know and started to remember \"Are you alright?\" Vader asked \"I\"m fine, I promise.\" Grace insisted \"Alright but if your sick get go straight to bed baby girl.\" Vader said softly \"What did you say?\" Grace said \"You know what you heard.\" \"Daddy is it really you?\" Grace smiled hopefully \"Grace Shmi Skywalker what go you think?\" Anakin replied smirking \"Dad I\"ve missed you so much!\" Grace said hugging her father with all her might and crying into his torso \"Shhhh I have too also so what happened to your mom?\" Anakin asked after he calmed his daughter down \"She doesn\"t remember getting married to you or giving birth to me or Luke and Leia.\" Grace said \"Well you and I will just have to jog her memory.\" Anakin thought \"How\"s that going to happen you have to be on the bridge of the Executor in about 4 hours or so\" Grace said \"We\"ll manage somehow.\" Anakin said Three hours later Vader, Padme and Grace were boarding the Executor, padme and Grace were wearing \"Stay here at all times.\" Anakin ordered playing the part of Vader then he left. Padme noticed that Grace was looking a little pale. \"Are you alright?\" Padme asked Grace shook her head \"I haven\"t been since I woke up.\" \"Go lay down sweetheart so I can take your temperature.\" Padme said then she looked for a thermometer and stuck it under Grace\"s tongue. Then the numbers of the temperature came to 102.3 so Grace had to stay in bed while Padme contacted Vader. \"What is it?\" Vader said irritated when Padme got through. \"Grace has a fever so she has to stay in bed.\" Padme said to him while trying not to bite his head off. \"I had noticed she wasn\"t herself but she said she was fine, and I have surprises when I get back.\" Vader said \"Ok.\" Padme said as she ended the call, she got a funny feeling that this has happened before. ~Flashback~ Padme was looking down at her two year old Grace Skywalker and felt her forehead which was warm \"Oh baby girl\" Padme whispered Padme got out a baby thermometer and took her daughter\"s temperature \"102.3 huh well I guess it\"s just you and I today huh?\" Padme said smiling down at her awake daughter Padme started to tickle her daughter to make her smile as Padme knew if she saw her smile she could get through another day After awhile padme fell asleep with her daughter next to her sleeping peacefully unlike the rest of the galaxy and all she wanted was her personal Jedi knight husband Anakin Skywalker to be there and the moment would be perfect. ~ End Flashback~ After the flashback, Padme was wondering where her so-called husband was after the speeder accident that erased her memories of their marriage and the birth and the first ten years of their daughter\"s life. It was hours it seemed till Anakin came back with two droids that could make Grace laugh so hard at their arguments, See-Threepio and R2-D2 But instead of laughing as was expected she fainted because she thought she wouldn\"t see them again \"What happened?\" Grace asked when she woke up from fainting. \"You fainted after seeing what I brought back.\" Anakin explained \"Oh I\"m sorry but those Droids...\" Explained Grace \"I know what they mean...\" Anakin tried to explain \"Thank you.\" Grace said knowing what he was trying to do Padme was shocked since what she had heard about Darth Vader was different to what she was seeing now maybe there is a heart underneath all destruction and death. \"Thank you for doing that for my daughter.\" Padm\u00e9 said \"It was nothing.\" Anakin replied \"I haven\"t seen her smile like that in a while.\" Padm\u00e9 said \"When she was younger I would do anything to make her smile so I can get through the day or even the week during the clone wars.\" Padme admitted \"Really? Why was it important?\" Anakin questioned his wife \"Yes, because I would get through the terrible fighting for another day or so and have the courage to fight to stop the fighting and let the diplomacy resume.\" Padm\u00e9 said smiling softly \"Now where have I heard that before?\" Anakin thought Turning to go to the living room he found himself closer to her than both of them thought. \"My head is saying one thing while my heart is saying another which one is right and which is wrong?\" Padm\u00e9 thought confused Anakin\"s heart was thumping the closer he got to kissing her \"I never thought I would be able to kiss her like this again.\" Anakin leaned down to kiss Padm\u00e9 Padm\u00e9 started to kiss him back but realized \"I can\"t be with him because I would betray the alliance.\" Padm\u00e9 thought Padm\u00e9 abruptly pulled away from the kiss \"We can\"t be together Vader.\" Padm\u00e9 said looking down avoiding his blue eyes \"I knew that she wouldn\"t be with me cause I\"m supposed to be the enemy but doesn\"t mean I won\"t try\" Anakin thought Anakin was not surprised to say the least but still said \"Why not?\" putting his hand under her chin so she\"ll look into his eyes \"Because we\"re on different sides of the conflict.\" Padm\u00e9 said breaking eye contact \"What about our feelings Padme?\" Anakin challenged \"Sometimes we have to sacrifice what we want to see the right things happen.\" Padm\u00e9 explained moving the other way \"But we can\"t reject our feelings forever you know that don\"t you?\" Anakin questioned \"Yes but it won\"t matter if one of us in prison or executed for their crimes.\" Padm\u00e9 retorted Anakin stormed out of the kitchen knowing she was right as always to see Grace watching a pod race on the television. \"I was trying to sleep but heard you and Mom Arguing on something.\" Grace explained Anakin sighed and sat down \"What do you think I should do Grace.\" \"I think you two should have a candle lit dinner just the two of you.\" Grace suggested \"That\"s a great idea Grace.\" Anakin said \"I\"ll have threepio make some bantha stake and some dessert.\" Grace said \"Threepio knows just what I want doesn\"t he?\" Anakin exclaimed \"Man I never thought I would talking with my dad like this again.\" Grace thought \"Yes he does cause you programed to know our favorite foods.\" Grace explained \"Yup I did cause wouldn\"t we take turns having our favorite foods for dinner?\" Anakin said \"Yeah and Luke, Leia and I programmed him once to talk like Master Yoda and you were just laughed until your were breathless.\" Grace remembered \"Yeah and you and Luke and Leia had to reprogram him again without help.\" Anakin said laughing remembering threepio talking like Yoda The laughter rang through the halls that Padm\u00e9 could hear from her quarters and crept into the hallway listening in \"Why is Grace that friendly with Vader when he\"s the enemy or is he?\" Later that night Grace set the table and Threepio lit the candles with matches and put the dinner on the table. When Anakin saw the table that Grace and Threepio set he was amazed. \"I never thought our daughter would go to all that trouble just for her mom and me.\" Anakin thought When Padme saw the table she thought that it was the most romantic thing anyone has done for her. Anakin pulled out her chair and Padme sat down and then sat down himself. \"You did all of this for me?\" Padme said surprised spinning around to look at the beautiful \"Yes I did with help from Grace and Threepio.\" Anakin said \"So how long have you been in politics Padm\u00e9?\" Anakin asked \"Since I was a about ten in legislative youth program, then at fourteen I was elected as queen then after two terms the Queen asked me to be senator and I couldn\"t refuse.\" Padm\u00e9 said Anakin smirked lightly remembering that conversation on the way to the palace before they admitted their feelings . \"What are you smiling about?\" Padm\u00e9 asked It\"s just I heard that before.\" Anakin said \"Where?\" Padm\u00e9 asked That is the end of this chapter but there will be a longer chapter next time and please, please review. Vader and Padme were having a great time until palpatine decided to intervene '\"Vader I thought you were searching for rebels not being an idiot!' He screeched Vader decided to go confront palpatine and end the conflict once and for all Palpatine started to blast him with lightning and passed out. Then woke up then flew to his ship and passed out he got into his quarters \"You\"re in your bedroom after you were attacked by the emperor.\" Faith and Padme explained \"Thank you but I thought you were mad at me Padme.\" Vader said \"I was forced to help.\" Padme explained Vader was saddened about that because he really loves her. \"I\"m surprised that you are being very quiet Faith.\" Vader and Padme said \"Because I\"ve been keeping a secret for about since you left the first morning.\" Faith explained", "First there was his mother, Nodoka. A traditional Japanese woman who seemed to lack common sense and sanity. To start with, she had married his father, Genma. Then she had allowed Genma to take her only son away at a young age and accepted a seppuku contract in his place to make him a \"man amongst men\". Sadly her idea of a manly man was a pervert. Then there was Genma. Fat, lazy bastard had dragged Ranma off on a ten year training journey that, while effective, was more a ten year torture trip. Fighting his own father for food, running from wolves with all there possessions as well as his father on his back, tied to the back of a moving train, thrown off cliff faces to learn how to fall, sold off as a fiance to feed his fathers stomach more times than he could count, neko-ken, curse. Most of Ranma\"s own problems could be traced back to the fat panda. The Fiance Brigade. Ukyo, Shampoo, and Akane. Ukyo had been his best childhood friend, even if he had thought she was a boy at the time. Genma had stolen her dowry and ditched her on the side of the road. She had been stripped of her femininity and forced to live as a boy by her father. Honor demanded she either kill him and Genma, marry him, or be cast out of her family a ronin. Shampoo was his own fault. He should have made Genma fight his own challenge after he\"d eaten the prize for the tournament at the amazon village. Instead he\"d battled shampoo, in his cursed form, and won. By the law of her village she swore to hunt Ranma-chan to the ends of the world and kill her. Then he\"d defeated her by accident as a guy, and by law she had to marry him. He was responsible for her getting cursed to turn into a c-c-c... those things that chase mice. That wouldn\"t be so bad, but the nut bar had actually fallen in love with him. Akane was a different kettle of fish. She hated him. He thought once that he had loved her. He\"d killed a freaking GOD for her. But did it matter. Hell no. she treated him like shit. Unfortunately, family honor demanded he marry the abusive twit. A promise to join the schools made between Soun and Genma before either had been born. Then there were the rivals. Oh yes, can\"t forget the bloody rivals. Moose, an amazon male who\"s only ambition in life was to kill Ranma and take Shampoo as his wife. Lets forget that Shampoo hates him as much as Akane hates Ranma. The blind hidden weapons master believed that if he killed Ranma, Shampoo would proclaim her love for him. Ryoga, the eternally lost boy. Cursed to turn into Akane\"s pet piglet. Everything that went wrong in his life was, naturally, Ranma\"s fault. He wanted Akane. He could have her for all Ranma cared. She treated him better anyway, in cursed form or not. Then there was the delusional Tatewaki Kuno... \"Hold Varlet!\" Ah! Speak of the devil. Ranma ceased his increasingly angry introspection. \"Come then, foul sorcerer, I the Blue Thunder of Furinkan High shall save the tigress Akane Tendo, and the Pig-Tailed Goddess from your Vile clutches! Have at thee!\" Ranma flipped lazily over the kendoists initial attack and prepared to put him down, again, when suddenly he had a idea. It was so crazy it might just work. \"Ah! sempi, at last I\"ve found you! I require help that only one as noble and powerful as you can give!\" Ranma shouted in his best Kunoese. Kuno stopped dead in his tracks, stupefied. \"Huh?\" \"Indeed! Listen closely sempi, for I do not know how much time I have. I have been placed under an enchantment to make me behave as the beast you thought me to be. The true foul sorcerer is none other than Genma Saotome!\" \"Ha! That I would believe such lies.\" Kuno scoffed. \"But it is true Lord Kuno!\" Ranma kicked it up a notch, \"The demon sought gain himself a dojo from Soun Tendo by forcing the fierce tigress Akane and this unworthy one to wed against our will. When I refused, he placed a most horrible enchantment on me to force my pursuit of her.\" \"But what of the pig-tailed girl? Why do you hold her in your clutches?\" Ranma smirked to himself inwardly. The fool was listening. \"My twin sister! Alas, for it is a most horrible story!\" \"Twin Sister!\" Kuno shouted in shock \"Indeed! I broke his enchantment upon me most recently and he restored it by sacrificing my beloved twin sister.\" \"Sacrifice! The Pig-Tailed Goddess!\" Tatewaki exclaimed in a rage. \"He sealed away her soul and imprisoned her form within my own. It can now only be viewed when I am hit with cold water. I can prove it to you.\" Ranma exclaimed. This was the tricky part. \"I require your help to save us all. We need to break the enchantments on myself and the rest of the Tendo household, as well as separate my sisters body from my own and recover her very soul!\" Tatewaki gazed at Ranma speculatively. \"Such a story is impossible to accept...\" \"I can prove it to you sempi. Just give me a chance!\" Ranma pleaded with what he hoped sounded a desperate voice. \"I will allow you to try, but I warn you Saotome, if you are lying...\" \"Please, you must save my sister the Pig-tailed Girl!\" Ranma hopped the fence and walked up to the canal on the other side. Kuno followed. \"Watch closely sempi.\" Ranma stepped into the water and changed into his cursed form. \"Pig-Tailed Girl!\" Kuno exclaimed \"Alas no, sempi. Merely her body for the Foul Sorcerer, Genma Saotome, has done this. I may return to my own body with warm water.\" Ranma pulled a thermos out of stuff space and poured it over her head after stepping out of the canal, instantly reverting to his male form. \"Only you can save us from this evil spell so that she may shower her affection upon you.\" Please let it work prayed Ranma \"This is so... it cannot be...\" Kuno looked gob smacked. Ranma had him, hook, line, and sinker. Now to cap the performance. \"AAAARGH!\" Ranma clutched at his head, falling to his knees. \"The spell! I can not fight it much longer!\" he started bringing up his battle aura, then pushing it down so that a blue light seemed to flicker about his body. \"Sempi! You must break Genma\"s spell! But beware, for he is a sneaky evil, and will use others to shield himself. The foul sorcerer can change his form to that of a large pandaAAAAHHH!\" He brought his aura up to the visible spectrum, ringing himself in blue light, \"I can hold it back no more! Please Lord Kuno!\" suddenly Ranma flared his aura out a foot from his body and blanked his face, then drew his aura back into himself before looking up at Kuno with his trademark smirk. \"So young Saotome thinks to get help in his plight does he.\" Ranma said in his best evil voice. \"Well it won\"t work. Master Genma will prevail.\" With that Ranma launched himself at Kuno and pummeled him into unconsciousness. Hope that worked he thought as he walked away, a spring in his step. Disclaimer - I don\"t own Ranma 1/2, or Rurouni Kenshin. I do, however, own Rumiko Takahashi and Mangaka Nobuhiro Watsuki. I bought their souls on E-Bay for 20 bucks each. Authors Note Kasumi doing the Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu. Nuff said. The Idea - Ranma and a few others see a palm reader at a local festival. The reader tells them a few things about their past lives, but this is Nerima, and everything here tends toward the crazy. They start to have weird dreams of the past lives she told them about, and gradually start showing some of the abilities from their past life. In the scenes below I have Ranma with Inu-Yasha, Kasumi with Kenshin Himura (past live need not actually be the same sex, or limited to one character really), and Nabiki referencing Merrill from Rune Soldier. Awakened Desires Ranma ducked into the brightly colored tent to avoid the NWC. He never expected the fortune teller to offer a free reading of his past lives. The price was right. With a shrug he had a seat across from the withered old woman. \"Such a long life line. You have many past lives.\" the old crone cackled. Ranma wasn\"t so sure about her. Seventeen wasn\"t really a long life, unless she meant he\"d survived enough near death experiences to fill a long life. \"I see your past, as clearly as I can see you, young man. Yes!\" She studied his palm carefully. \"I see a girl, your soul mate. With long dark hair... and the powers of a miko.\" \"I don\"t need no more fiances.\" he almost pulled his hand back, but the crone held on. \"In your past, I see a sword...\" \"Maybe in my future.\" Ranma muttered, thinking of his mother and that damn seppuku pledge. \"I see a demonic presence.\" \"Happosai.\" he said under his breath. \"And many rivals, and battles.\" \"So you see last Tuesday. Great. Thanks.\" Ranma grouched, getting up and walking out. \"Hiten Mitsurugi Style Lightning Umbrella!\" The rapidly spinning umbrella deflected all six kunai thrown by the surprised ninja. His gaze snapped up from the simple tool to the woman who owned it. She was quite pretty, with long brown hair bound in a ponytail pulled over her shoulder. She wore a simple dress and had quite a cheerful look to her. \"Oh my, those could have hurt someone Mr. Ninja, that they could.\" The girl said in gentle admonishment. The ninjas left eye twitched. Better not to say anything, yes, best to attack when faced with such a deceptive opponent. The ninja drew his ninja-to and thrust at his calm opponent. \"Hiten Mitsurugi Style Dodge the Big Boar!\" The cute girl shouted, Dodging his charge and whacking him in the back with her now closed umbrella. The ninja staggered forward off balance for a moment before spinning around to face... nothing. \"Hiten Mitsurugi Style Umbrella Smash!\" The ninja looked up just in time to take the umbrella full force to the face as the girl descended. \"Oh my, poor Mr. Ninja.\" the girl said, one hand to her mouth as she gazed at her swirly eyed attacker. \"You\"ll catch a cold if you keep lying in that puddle, that you will.\" The ninja suddenly sat strait up, shaking his head violently. \"W-What happened?\" \"I\"m afraid you took a nasty hit Mr. Ninja. Why were you attacking me, if I may ask?\" The girl said, helping the ninja to stand. \"Um... yeah... sorry about that miss...\" \"Kasumi Tendo.\" \"Miss Tendo. I was just a little short of this months car insurance payment, and I am a ninja, so...\" \"So you thought that you\"d mug some one.\" The girl finished for him. \"That\"s not very nice Mr. Ninja, that it\"s not.\" the girl frowned. For some reason the ninja couldn\"t help but want to do anything to avoid that frown. He hadn\"t felt that way since the last time he had seen his dear mother. \"Awww, c\"mon Miss Tendo! I\"m a ninja! Attack from shadows and all that! If you think I\"m a crook, you should see my insurance company\"s rates!\" The girl seemed to think about that for a moment before turning a smile at the ninja. \"Have you tried switching to Geico?\" The ninja faceplanted. \"Shi Shi Hokodan!\" Ranma slammed into a wall, spider webbing it in cracks from the impact. He was bruised, bleeding, and very, very angry. Ryoga rushed forward to continue his assault, but suddenly stopped when Ranma\"s eyes flashed a demonic red. His hand reached up, pressing against one of his many cuts before striking out in a flash of movement, flinging blood at Ryoga. \"Blades of Blood!\" he growled out in a shout. The Ki infused blood whipped at Ryoga like a series of blades. He was so shocked he almost forgot to dodge. He totally missed it when Ranma leaped into the air, coming down as if to claw him with his hand. \"Iron Reaver Soul Stealer!\" Ryoga watched as a set of golden claws composed entirely of Ki shredded his forearms, hastily erected across his chest to block. Looking at his bloodied arms, Ryoga realized that Ranma was out for blood. He was fighting with lethal intent, not like he usually did. Ryoga smiled \"This is more like it! Now I\"ll kill you and nobody will be able to deny you deserved it!\" Ryoga whipped off his belt and infused it with Ki, stiffening it into a leather sword. \"Die!\" he shouted, charging at his enemy. \"My Darling Jar!\" Nabiki screamed out, bolting up right in her bed, flinging cold sweat with the force of that action. Now awake she took deliberate deep breaths to get her heart under control. What the hell was that all about? Harry Potter and the Laz-E-Boy of Doom Disclaimer - where I say I don\"t own nuthin Authors Note = brief note before the show General Idea - Harry steals Voldemorts chair. Dumbledore wants it, but Harry ain\"t giving it up. Voldemort really wants his chair back! \"VOLDEMORT!\" Harry Potter burst into the Dark Lords throne room, wand at the ready. He\"d finally figured out where the Dark Lord had been hiding, through their connection. Now he was here, ready to end it. A tumble weed blew across the chamber floor. It was just how he remembered it from the visions. A large room, bereft of any furniture and decorations, save for the single chair made from bones and skulls sitting on the stone dais overlooking the room. Exactly the same. But empty. \"Oh, come on!\" Harry was exasperated. He stalked across the room, kicking the tumbleweed for good measure, as he ranted about the unfairness of it all. Here he was, in the Dark Lords personal sanctum, ready and willing to go. And the tosser was nowhere to be found. What the hell! Harry flopped down angrily on Voldemorts bone throne. Maybe he could just wait here for the Dark Lord to return. He could always blast his head off then. Sure, the Death Eaters would then massacre him, but he\"d been expecting that when he first walked in. My god this chair was comfortable. It was, perhaps, the most comfortable chair he had ever sat in. As Harry luxuriated in the Laz-E-Boy of Doom, as Voldemort had dubbed his very favorite chair, a plan began to form. HP Lord Voldemort strode into his throne room, a smile on his snake like face. It had been a good day. He killed some muggles, tortured some of his followers, and stolen some candy from a baby. Now, he had the rest of the day to himself. Nothing to do but sit in his... \"Where the hell did my throne go!\" Voldemort was no longer happy. He rushed to the raised dais only to discover a parchment note where his throne once stood. Dear Dork Lord, We have your chair. Call off your rein of terror, or you\"ll never see it again. We mean it! The note was unsigned. The Dark Lord had never been this angry in his life. He would find the chair-nappers, and when he did... HP \"No, Harry!\" Hermione was appalled. \"You can not keep that, that, that... thing, here!\" \"But \"Mione...\" \"Don\"t you \"Mione me! You simply cannot keep a throne made out of bones in the common room.\" She sniffed. \"Where did you get that dreadful thing anyway?\" \"Stole it from the Dark Tosser.\" Harry said nonchalantly. \"It\"s the most comfortable chair I\"ve ever sat in.\" \"I don\"t care if it... THE DARK LORD!\" Hermione was horrified. \"You stole the Dark Lords throne!\" \"Bloody Brilliant, mate!\" Ron piped up from the corner of the room, where he was demolishing Nevile Longbottom in a game of chess. \"Language Ron.\" Hermione tossed out, purely on reflex. \"Harry, explain.\" One convoluted, unlikely, and somewhat contrived sounding explanation later, \"Oh, I suppose that makes sense then.\" Hermione said. \"I thought so.\" Harry nodded sagely. \"Anyway, back to the matter at hand. By the fire you think, so I can watch the flames and keep warm?\" \"No, Harry. You still can\"t keep the Dark Lords throne in the common room.\" Hermione was exasperated. \"You should take it to the Headmaster.\" \"You need to sit in the chair.\" Harry intoned confidently. \"I most certainly do not!\" \"Oh, yes.\" he dragged the word out in a hiss. \"No, Harry.\" \"Yes.\" and with that Harry scooped up Hermione. \"Harry!\" Hermione shouted, fighting the instant blush, \"Put me down this instant!\" \"Your wish is my command.\" Harry smiled, dropping her into the chair. \"Harry! I can\"t believe you just... wow!\" Hermione wriggled around in the chair for a moment. \"This thing really is comfortable.\" \"See!\" Harry said victoriously. HP \"I need to know everything there is to know about Potters friends, Lucius.\" the Dark Lord hissed menacingly. This new chair, while looking like is old one, was not nearly as comfortable. He shifted restlessly. \"He has something... preciouses... to me. I will have revenge. Everything he cares for will burn and die before him.\" \"At once my lord.\" Lucius bowed lower, kissed the hem of the Dark Lords robes, and backed out of the throne room. Yes, the boy would pay, and pay dearly. Voldemort shifted again. Merlin he missed his chair. HP Dumbledore smiled in his grandfatherly way, eyes twinkling as he gazed upon his student. Sitting across from him was one Harry Potter. Harry was slightly nervous as he sat in his comfy new chair. What if the headmaster disapproved of his bone throne? What if he demanded he be rid of it? Harry didn\"t think he could do that! \"My boy, that\"s quite a chair you have their.\" Dumbledore smiled. \"But perhaps a throne made from the bones of your enemies does not send the right message of being a light wizard.\" he once more checked the enchantments on the chair through his enchanted spectacles. Yes, a chair that comfy must be his... for the greater good! \"Still, I wouldn\"t deprive you of your justly earned rewards. Therefore...\" he paused dramatically, \"I offer you a trade!\" With a wave of his wand, another chair became disillusioned. It was roughly the same size, but overstuffed and comfortable looking. And it was seemingly made out of lemon drops. Harry sweatdropped. \"Um... thanks, professor, but I think I\"ll stick with this one. Thanks.\" \"But Harry, how will light wizards think of you, when you sit in a chair made from the bones of your enemies?\" Dumbledore tried. \"It\"s not the bones of my enemies headmaster. I took the chair from Voldemort, so it\"s the bones of his enemies.\" He paused, looking thoughtful. \"if the enemy of my enemy is my friend, then I suppose that makes them the bones of my friends. Hardly any better. But I didn\"t know any of the people he used, so how could they actually be my friends?\" Harry turned to one of the skulls on his arm rest. \"Hey Ron. How\"s it hanging?\" \"Not too well mate.\" Harry moved the jaw up and down, talking out the corner of his mouth in a fair impression of his best friend. \"I\"m just a skull now. No dangly bits.\" Harry spun to the skull on the other arm rest. \"Oh Harry, did you finish your homework for potions?\" he said out the corner of his mouth in a high pitched version of Hermione\"s voice while moving it\"s jaw. \"Not yet, Hermione. Don\"t worry, It\"s almost done.\" He looked up at the headmasters mildly horrified face. \"Yeah, I don\"t think that works. I\"ll see what I can do about the bones, sir.\" Harry mentally added a \"not\" to the end of his sentence. Like he would do anything that might change the awesomeness of his new chair! HP \"We\"ve learned all that we can of the Potter boy\"s friends, my Lord.\" Lucius groveled. \"Tell me!\" snapped Voldemort. Ever since his throne had been pilfered the Dark Lord had been in a fowl mood. Despite the glamor charm, no matter how many cushioning charms he placed on the impressive looking easy chair he now sat on, it just couldn\"t equal the Laz-E-Boy of Doom. \"The Weasley family is still a difficult target. The Wards on their home are formidable, and the only time the father is seen outside of the wards is when he\"s at work in the ministry. The mudblood seems to be the easy target. Minor wards on her home, but her parents have a business with no protections. A \"Granger and Granger Dentistry Clinic\"\" \"Very well, take a group of deatheaters and... wait, did you say Dentistry?\" The Dark Lord remembered his time in the muggle orphanage. He remembered when they were subjected to drills and pliers and assorted tortures at the hands of those muggle dentists. \"Yes my Lord. Shall I take a death squad and remove them?\" \"No! Dentists are far to dangerous. They are masters of muggle tortures. The things they do...\" Voldemort shuddered. \"No. The mudbloods parents are off limits.\" Perhaps one of his minions within the school could steal back his chair... HP \"Hey, Mate.\" Ron asked Harry, who was currently reclining in his throne, reading a Brooms Quarterly. \"Can I borrow your invisibility cloak? I\"m starved and want to go to the kitchens.\" \"Oh?\" Harry said, reaching down to the side of his chair, under the arm rests. He pulled one of the bones, and a hidden compartment opened with a burst of cold air. He reached in and pulled out a butterbeer and a slice of mint chocolate cake. \"Here ya go, Ron.\" \"Bloody hell! That\"s brilliant!\" Ron shouted. \"I know.\" Harry smirked. HP \"Mr. Potter,\" Dumbledore had harry in his office again, \"perhaps you would trade for this chair!\" Dumbledore said triumphantly. Once again he flicked his wand, disillusioning a new chair. This one was seemingly carved of gold, the Griffendor lion prominently featured. \"That is a rather nice chair.\" Harry eyed the gaudy monstrosity. Were those actual rubies for the lions eyes? \"But I think I\"ll stick with what I have.\" \"Ah,\" Dumbledore sat in the gold chair, \"but can your chair do this?\" with that the chair actually got up and started walking around the room. \"I noticed you had to have your chair moved to your classes by the house elves. With this chair, it won\"t be a problem!\" \"Actually, sir, Hermione found out my chair could do this.\" And his chairs legs, made from the skeletons of snakes, began moving. Soon, his chair was slithering about, faster, and with a far smoother ride than Dumbledore\"s lion throne. \"Bugger.\" Dumbledore acknowledged his defeat."]}

Maria whimpered softly. \"Please don\"t do this.\" \"Lowe!\" Heero shouted, trying to break free from his captors. \"Spread your fingers.\" He said again. \"Please...\" She whispered. Lowe sighed in frustration. \"Maria if you won\"t do as you\"re told, I\"ll have to remove your whole hand.\" Slowly, she spread her trembling fingers onto the tray and closed her eyes as the knife was aligned with her pinkie finger. He looked at Heero. \"See what happens when you don\"t play by the rules?\" Heero met his eyes. \"Please, don\"t. I\"ll do whatever it is you want me to do. Just don\"t harm her.\" He begged. \"It\"s too late.\" Maria screamed in pain as she felt the stainless steel sharp edge of the knife saw its way through her finger. Tears trickled down her face and she was vaguely aware of her father screaming at Lowe from somewhere in the distance. When she felt the knife reach the bone her screams became louder and more painfilled. Heero\"s heart thumped in his chest as he watched his beautiful daughter be mutilated by Lowe. His throat became hoarse from shouting and he felt weak from struggling so violantly. He felt his knees sink to the ground and the rest of his body with them. \"Maria...\" he said numbly. Maria\"s screams disintegrated into quiet whimpers as the last part of her finger was cut through. Lowe cackled as he held it up triumphantly before putting it into Maria\"s skirt pocket. Grasping her hand in disbelief, she watched the blood pour out form the stump where her finger used to be. She could feel it in her pocket, poking into her leg as if it were still attached to her. She looked at her father kneeling on the floor and felt a deep burning hatred for Lowe for what he\"d put her family through. Heero brought his eyes up to Maria\"s and they looked at each other. He just wanted to hold her in his arms and take her home. He just wanted to protect her. But he hadn\"t. He had failed her once again. \"Come on now,\" Lowe said to Maria, stroking her hair affectionately. \"You still have another one.\" \"You bastard,\" Maria whispered. \"You Goddamn bastard.\" Lowe tore his attention from her as he heard Heero laughing hysterically. He sneered at him. \"What\"s so funny?\" \"I\"m expecting company any time now,\" He said. At that moment, their was a sudden burst of gunfire from all directions as the windows shattered and bullets flew everywhere. Seeing his chance, Heero burst free from the unsuspecting men and raced towards Maria. He tore the ropes from around her legs and dragged her by the hand through the nearest door. Lowe screamed at him from behind the tray were he was taking cover until he had loaded up his gun. Heero didn\"t hear what he said. He sprinted down the many corridors with Maria behind him until he had finally reached the exit. Maria saw Duo and Danny standing beside a car. \"I want you to wait here.\" Heero commanded. \"Dad, let\"s just go.\" \"No. I have to finish this.\" Maria jutted her bottom lip out. \"Okay. But...be careful.\" Heero hugged her tightly. \"I love you.\" He ran back inside. \"Jesus!\" Duo exclaimed and took her injured hand gently so he could wrap it up in bandages. \"What happened?\" Danny asked. Maria put her other hand in her pocket and pulled out her finger. \"He cut it off.\" She quietly said. \"It\"ll be okay,\" Duo said. \"If we can get you to a hospital then they can save it.\" \"Then what are we waiting for?\" Danny asked impatiently. \"I\"m not leaving until I know my dad\"s okay,\" Maria replied. The two males knew better than to argue with her and waited. About five minutes later, Heero reappeared. Maria noticed blood on his hands. \"Is it over?\" She asked. He smiled softly at her. \"Yes.\" Please review! jellybean-kitty Some Questions Answered Maria watched the world go by in a blur as she was carried into the nearest hospital. The blood she had lost and the trauma of the situation were catching up on her as she swayed on the verge of consciousness. She was vaguely aware of her father\"s arms picking her up from the car, which would explain her sensation of weightlessness. She felt herself being set down on a soft chair and Danny sat beside her and sat swaying slightly, unable to control her body due to the dizziness that was sweeping over her. A doctor appeared before her, looking at a clipboard. \"Maria Grace Yuy? Correct?\" \"Yuh-huh,\" She replied. \"I hardly use my middle name. I don\"t know why. It\"s nice!\" \"I see you had a little accident-\" \"Little my ass!\" She shrieked. \"My goddamn finger was cut off!\" \"Maria, take it easy,\" Danny said soothingly. She huffed angrily and looked at the doctor\"s name tag. \"I\"m sorry Doctor....Burns, please, continue.\" Burns cleared his throat. \"Well, I think we\"ll be able to sew it back on-\" \"With a needle?\" \"A surgical needle, but yes. We\"ll need to hurry though. You\"ve also lost a lot of blood. Do you feel nauseous at all, or light headed?\" Maria tittered. \"Uhuh. Like I\"m wasted but without the alcohol. I like it.\" \"I see.\" He said and wrote something down on his board. \"Wotcha writing, Doc?\" \"What you\"re saying. Do you have the finger with you?\" She nodded vigorously which caused her to almost fall off her chair but Danny steadied her. \"It\"s in here.\" She held out her closed fist. Burns pried it open and removed the finger which was inside. He studied it closely, making more notes on his board. \"Odd...\" \"What\"s odd?\" Danny asked. \"This looks like it\"s been done by a professional...it\"s so neat. A clean cut. How did you say it happened?\" Heero appeared behind her. \"A kitchen accident. She was using a knife and her hand slipped.\" Burns frowned and looked at the wound again. \"Maria?\" \"What he said,\" She pointed as Heero. He frowned again but said nothing more on the subject. \"Why don\"t we get you a bed, now. Then we can fix your mishap.\" Sure thing.\" Once again she felt a pair of strong arms lift her and followed Burns until he led them into an empty room. She was placed on the bed gently. A nursed came in with a drip filled with blood and attached it to a vein in Maria\"s arm. She watched it in fascination as it trickled into her body. \"Maria?\" A voice called out. \"Maria!\" She turned away from the drip and looked at the doctor. \"Hey, where\"s my dad? And Danny?\" \"I asked them to leave for just now. Until we\"ve got that finger back on and you\"ve rested for a bit, I don\"t think you should see anyone.\" He took a needle from a tray in front of him. It looked uncannily like the one Lowe used, Maria noticed. There were all sorts of tools there: scalpels, scissors. Then she spotted a knife which resembled the one that had removed her finger, almost down to a tee. Before she knew what was had come over her she was screaming at the top of her lungs. Burns tried to calm her down but she was twisting and writhing so violently he had to call for more doctors. \"Don\"t take my other one!\" She screamed. \"Please don\"t take it!\" Heero rushed in. \"What\"s wrong with her? What did you do?\" He asked Burns angrily. \"I don\"t know! She was looking at my tool tray and then she started going wild!\" Heero stroked his daughter\"s hair as she felt a needle being inserted into her arm. All at once she felt at peace and stopped screaming. Burns and Heero swapped glances and the doctor swallowed nervously, unnerved by Heero\"s warning glares. He cleared his throat again. \"If you\"ll just step outside I can begin.\" He waited until Heero shifted, closing the door behind him. \"Okay Maria, I\"m just going to numb your hand. You won\"t be able to feel a thing.\" She watched as he gave her jags on either side of the where her finger used to be. He then began to rejoin her finger to the rest of her hand. Maria found it so fascinating. A few hours later, Maria was sitting in the hospital bed with Danny, Duo, Heero, Trowa, Quatre and Wufie. Danny was inspecting the stitching in her hand carefully and wiggling it about to see if it would fall off. \"Hey!\" Maria scolded. \"Cut that out!\" \"Sorry,\" He grinned sheepishly. \"Can you move it on your own yet?\" \"No,\" She said. \"And I might never have full control over it but at least it\"s there and I\"m not all disfigured or whatever.\" She ate a chocolate from a tray which her had been bought for her. \"By the way, you never told me how we escaped?\" \"It was pretty easy,\" Duo began. \"You see, Lowe had a problem with being too cocky. See, he figured that we\"d be powerless to do anything so he didn\"t exactly have tight security. I mean he must have only had like, what, thirty men or something? I mean that kind of arrogance is just ridiculous.\" \"This coming from you?\" Quatre said. Duo grinned charmingly. \"See, I have a reason to be.\" \"Okay so minimum security. Got it. But how did we actually escape?\" Maria pressed. Duo began to explain again but Trowa interrupted. \"Once Danny had got out, we got onto the roof and abseiled down the side so we were at the window. We waited until we were all in position and then-\" \"BANG! BANG!\" Duo interrupted. Trowa looked at Duo witheringly. \"May I remind you, Duo, that you didn\"t actually fire any weapons at all?\" He continued on with his story. \"We took out his men and getting you out was pretty easy since Lowe hadn\"t considered for one moment to guard any entrances and the rest of his entourage were coming in to fight us off.\" Maria frowned. \"But Lowe still knew you were there before even I did.\" Quatre shifted. \"I had hacked into his security so I could keep an eye on his cameras but it seems he had a protection programme that alerted him if there have been unwanted visitors within the system.\" \"Well, that pretty much explains everything,\" She looked slyly at Heero. \"Except what happened to Lowe.\" \"It doesn\"t matter,\" He said quickly. \"He isn\"t going to bother us anymore.\" \"It matters to me...\" Maria quietly said. Suddenly a burly, busty, black nurse, who Maria considered a big bit on the plump side, came bursting into the room, clapping her tinted hands as she went. \"Alright. Visiting hours are over. Miss Yuy needs her rest.\" She said as she cleared the room. \"My, my. All men? You are one lucky lady, Miss.\" She put her hands on her hips as she watched them all leave. \"Mmmhmmm. Very lucky.\" \"My father, my friends and.....I guess they\"re like my uncles,\" Maria explained, not knowing whether or not she was heard. The nurse seemed none the wiser as she bustled about the room readjusting this and fixing that back into place. \"I\"ll be back with your dinner in no time. You must be starved!\" She said after taking Maria\"s temperature and heart rate. Before leaving she added: \"My name is Nurse Jenny. But everyone calls me Mama.\" I can see why, thought Maria. A few minutes later, Mama came back with a plate of hot food and set it in front of Maria. She picked up the fork, scooped a bit of the mince and potatoes and stuck it into her mouth. She chewed for a while, then grimaced and spat it out into the bin next to her bed. \"Ewwww!\" She said. \"What\"s wrong, child?\" Asked Mama. Maria pouted. \"I hate hospital food.\" Heero sat in the driver\"s seat of his car in the company of Duo and Danny. He was concentrating hard on the roads and not even attempting to join in on their inane conversation. Like father, like son. \"So, Heero. What exactly did you do to Lowe?\" Duo ventured. \"I killed him,\" Heero simply replied. \"But, how?\" Heero sighed impatiently. \"Come on. I want to know the details,\" \"I don\"t actually remember. I started punching him and I spaced out. When I stopped myself I guess I\"d gone too far.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean you\"d need dental records to identify him.\" Danny laughed, thinking this was a joke. \"Uh kiddo, he ain\"t fooling,\" His father said. Danny stopped abruptly. \"You mean, you liked, battered him to death?\" Heero shrugged nonchalantly. \"He deserved it.\" \"Well, yeah, but...ouch.\" \"Must have hurt, huh?\" Duo asked. \"I hope so. He screamed a lot.\" Duo nodded, a little impressed whereas Danny said nothing more. Heero turned the steering wheel sharply up their drive way. \"You\"re here.\" \"Well,\" Duo said climbing out. \"It was good to work with ya again. We need to do it again sometime.\" As soon as the car door was shut, Heero sped off. Sorry about the Scooby Doo likeness of this chapter but some things needed explaining lol. Please review! Jellybean-kitty Mommy\"s Back \"It feels good to be back, huh?\" Asked Maria, as she met Danny at the school cafeteria for lunch. \"Well, yeah cause we have been gone for a long time,\" Danny replied sarcastically. \"You know what I mean!\" She smiled widely. \"It feels good to be back to normal.\" \"I guess. Or as normal as can be. Are things okay with your dad, then?\" Her smile widened. \"Couldn\"t be better. We\"re picking up my mom tonight. She\"s coming back.\" Danny grabbed for her injured finger. \"Does she know about this?\" \"Oww,\" Maria yelled. \"Danny it\"s still sore.\" He let go of it with a slight smirk on his face and she rubbed it tenderly. \"And kind of. She knows about it but doesn\"t know about it.\" \"So how did it happen then?\" \"Jammed in my car door,\" She said with air quotes. \"Which reminds me. I\"ve almost finished driver\"s ed,\" she continued in a sing song voice Danny faked a shocked expression. \"Really? Wow. It only took you, like, half a year!\" \"What\"s wrong with that?\" \"It\"s a twelve week course.\" Maria ignored him and concentrated on her salad, picking daintily at the leaves of lettuce and slices of tomato. Danny, on the other hand, bit into his burger like it was going out of fashion. He chewed loudly and Maria looked at him in disapproval. \"What?\" He asked \"Nothing, I just can\"t stop staring at the poor half mangled cow that\"s in your mouth.\" \"Oh. Okay.\" He swallowed and took another huge bite. \"That is so gross,\" She quickly finished off her salad and stood up. \"I\"ll see you later since, I, Maria May Yuy, have been appointed president of the Prom Committee and there is a meeting of said Committee in five minutes.\" \"Congratulations?\" Danny tried. \"Well, whatever. Make sure it\"s a good one, okay?\" \"Daniel! I\"m surprised at you!\" She tossed her hair over her shoulder. \"With me in charge how could it possibly go wrong?\" She leaned down and whispered in his ear. \"And if the time comes to nominate girls for prom queen, who have you to say?\" Danny rolled his eyes. \"You.\" \"Thanks. I\"ll love you for it.\" Maria stood up and gathered her papers into a neat pile before addressing the whole committee. \"I propose that this year we should forget our normal Ballroom theme and move onto something a little more today.\" She saw some people give her questioning looks and she smiled confidently. \"When I say today I mean modern music, MTV style. Ballroom was great twenty years ago but today it\"s a big no-no. So anyone who disagrees with me, raise your hand now.\" She scanned the room and glowered at the one person who started to oppose her until the poor girl quickly decided against it. \"So, we\"re all agreed. Modern it is! I guarantee this is going to be the best prom ever!\" She beamed as she got a little applause from her audience of twenty. The bell then rang to begin their next class and so they disbanded after everyone was assigned specific duties Maria had decided upon. She loved being in charge. Heero watched the roads carefully while Maria, who sat in the front seat next to him, fiddled with the radio until she found a station she liked. He watched her out of the corner of his eye as they stopped at traffic lights. She was now playing with the air conditioning, adjusting it, sitting back then readjusting it. Then she rolled down her window, stuck her head out and let the air from passing cars blow into her hair. Heero heard car horns from behind him and realised the light was green again. He pressed down on the accelerator and drove on. \"Daddy,\" Maria said eventually in a girlish voice. \"I need to ask you for something.\" Heero sighed. \"What is it and how much will it cost me?\" It was funny how a few weeks ago she absolutely despised him and now she was back to being his little girl. \"It\"s a prom dress. I want a really nice one that no one else will have.\" She made her biggest eyes at him. \"I want it custom made so it\"s special.\" \"How much?\" \"Maybe around a three thousand dollars?\" Heero looked at her in shock. \"What?\" \"Please, Daddy?\" She clasped her hands together. \"I won\"t enjoy myself unless I know there\"s no chance of anyone turning up in the same outfit.\" Her voice turned serious. \"Do you know how humiliating that will be?\" \"That\"s a lot of money for a dress you\"ll only wear once, honey,\" Heero said. She pouted. \"But Daddeeeeeeee. Come on. I totally deserve it!\" \"Define how you deserve it.\" \"Well, I\"m head of committee, I\"m totally getting top grades in all my classes and I, you know, got my finger hacked off by your arch nemesis.\" She cast him a sly look. \"And I\"m not even telling mom.\" \"He wasn\"t really my arch nemesis...\" \"Pleeease?\" Heero let out a deep sigh, knowing he was defeated. \"I\"ll see what I can do.\" \"I love you, Daddy.\" She said and kissed him on the cheek. Me or my wallet, thought Heero. An hour later Maria and Heero waited in the airport for Relena\"s plane to land. They both stared up at the arrival screen like it would disappear at any moment. Why Relena had chosen to go on a commercial flight rather than a private was beyond them. Maria tapped her foot impatiently and stuck a piece of gum in her mouth. Heero could hear her huffing and puffing. He knew she didn\"t like to be kept waiting. He wondered what version of his daughter he preferred: the spoiled daddy\"s girl or the rebellious I-hate-you-so-much. The latter was at least cheaper. \"Oh-oh!\" Maria squealed. \"It\"s landed!\" Heero looked up and saw that his daughter was right. Her smile was so wide; he thought it might burst from all the excitement. He let himself smile a little bit. He was happy to see him wife again and not just on a computer screen or television or newspaper. He hadn\"t seen her in the flesh for so long. He had missed the feeling of her cool, pale and always soft skin against his. He\"d missed begin able to kiss her anytime, anyplace. He missed her. Maria pointed excitedly. \"There she is!\" Relena had appeared in a black suit with had been tailored to fit her slender body perfectly. Her long, blonde hair shone brightly as it swept around in its low ponytail. If Heero hadn\"t known any better he would have thought it was Maria up there. Relena smiled happily when she saw her family standing there to greet her. She walked towards them gracefully, her bodyguards-who also carried her luggage- kept a step behind. She was well aware of the murmurs from people as the recognised who she was. Maria ran up and through her arms around her mother, breathing in the clean scent she always remembered as a child: a mixture of talcum powder and perfume. She felt her loving arms wrap around her and held on tighter, afraid that if she let go she\"d lose Relena again. Heero kissed Relena softly and could hear the clicks of camera\"s and see the flash of bulbs from ghost photographers who somehow knew Relena would be here. He always wondered how they found out. \"I\"ve missed you both so much,\" Relena said with tears in her eyes. \"Mom, I\"ve missed you too.\" Heero looked around him. \"I think we should head off now.\" He took Relena\"s bags from the bodyguards and led the way to the parked car while Relena and Maria babbled insistently behind him. There were somethings that never change, such as Maria and Relena\"s bond that seemed to never break no matter how long they\"ve been away from each other. He let his mind wonder if it would be that same for him if he went away. When he came back, would he be treated like a stranger? It was the fact Relena had never been like that which had brought him out of his stoicness all those years ago. \"So,\" Relena said Maria when they were back home. \"Tell me everything you\"ve been up to.\" Maria looked at Heero like they shared a huge secret. \"Well, you know me. Same old same old.\" Relena put her hand on Heero\"s knee. \"And what about you?\" \"Nothing new.\" \"Oh my. You two are boring!\" She exclaimed. \"I thought I\"d come back here to lots of juicy gossip.\" \"Actually,\" Maria said thoughtfully, \"My prom is coming up.\" \"Have you found your dress?\" \"Not yet. I want it made specifically for me, though.\" Relena smiled in reminisce. \"I remember my first school ball. That\"s were me and your father shared our first dance.\" She chuckled to herself. \"I remember it all too well. The dress I had got was an original, too.\" She placed a finger on her chin. \"In fact, I think the company who made it is still in business.\" She looked at Maria. \"Oh, they are so beautiful. I\"ll take you there on Saturday and we can see what you think.\" \"That sounds great,\" Maria gushed. \"I also have a running for prom queen so I have to make sure I\"m in a dress no one else will have.\" \"Can you imagine, Heero?\" Relena sighed happily. \"Our little Maria as prom queen.\" \"Hn.\" \"Anyway, how was your campaign?\" Maria asked. Relena waved her hand. \"Tiring yet successful. I was able to reach out to the deprived colonies and gain their support. I\"m just glad to be back. I thought after the Eve Wars, I would never be in another spacecraft again-oops!\" She put her hand over her mouth like that would erase the slip of the tongue.", "Please review! jellybean-kitty Mann, I can\"t wait for the next chapter! It\"s going to be maybe unexpected or completely predictable. Whatever, I can\"t wait for it! Hope you enjoy this one! Had he not lost the function of his sweat glands in his rebirth, Voldemort was certain that his perspirations would have match those of an athletes or a criminal about to be trialled for death row. The latter comparison would have suited him better, sports never being his forte. This potential perspiration wasn\"t a result of overtaxing himself physically but it was more due to his nerves being shattered. He was about to go on air live and he still didn\"t know who he was about to go on air with. How was he expected to involve himself in conversation with some one he might not even have heard off and wouldn\"t have had time to research? Even common conversation required forward planning on his part. However, at the present moment he had nothing. Nada. Zilch. As much data as a crashed computer. And it unnerved him to the fullest. He was directly in the public eye. A single mistake could sink his entire career before it had really started and he could see that there would be many more than just a single mistake being made. He quite liked this job. He didn\"t want it to end so abruptly. Well, he at the moment he didn\"t think he did. Who knew what would happen after the next episode fulfilled his contract? He certainly didn\"t and his producers wouldn\"t either. He was the Dark Lord, after all. Unpredictable was his middle name. Well, it was actually Humphrey but he had never told anyone that and wasn\"t planning on telling anyone either. The light\"s went up and he knew it was time to go on stage and take his place in the chair. He turned around to glare at Larry for not giving him a warning. Then his heart began to pound harder than he\"d ever felt it do so before. Really, it was unreasonable for him to be so worried. Foolish, really. He could give himself a corony or worse. Besides, what was the worst thing that could happen? Worst case scenario his guest is the dullest man alive in which case surely it would be their reputation and not his that suffered? One could only hope. He could easily get by with the life saving \"So tell me about yourself\". That would work every time. There. He was saved. Nothing to worry about now. Find out the basics and then he could work from there. He was, afterall, a mastermind. What was a silly little interview when he had almost succeeded in global domination? The two didn\"t even compare to each other. \"Good evening my faithful viewers. I\"m delighted to have you with me here tonight. I would say you were in for one heck of a show but since I don\"t know who my guest actually is I may be lying.\" There was laughter which confused him. He hadn\"t been joking. \"They should be apparating in a few-\" A loud crack sounded through the air and his guest appeared, sitting comfortably in the chair with a smirk. \"Hello, master,\" Bellatrix Lestrange purred, sliding her hand easily over the arm of her chair. \"It\"s been a while, hasn\"t it?\" Voldemort swallowed hard, not quite believing what his snake eyes were seeing. But, as real as he was, Bellatrix Lestrange was sitting across from him, dawning her usual all black attire and her hair slightly askew. Her smouldering eyes scorched his very soul as she watched him carefully, waiting for his first words. Licking his lips, he said, \"So tell me about yourself?\" She giggled and then smiled. \"Surely I don\"t need to tell you anything about me. I doubt there\"s anything you wouldn\"t know from the day of my birth to the day of my death.\" \"No, you\"re quite right. But, erm, you look...well, alive. How did that happen?\" Shrugging, Bellatrix replied, \"Something about your past shows and my being interesting. I suppose thats what they say about pale people, right? Pale and interesting. That\"s me easily.\" \"You forgot deadly, sadistic and evil. However those are only some of your strong points,\" Voldemort reminded her with a slight quirk of his eyebrows. \"You always were one of my most loyal and praised death eaters, though I\"m sure you don\"t need me to tell you that. What, with you finishing off many enemies of mine with delightful cruelty to mix.\" \"Sure,\" She agreed, her voice pouty and slightly indignant, \"until that vile Weasley woman killed me off just because I might have murdered one of her kids. I don\"t see what the problem was. She had plenty more to spare. I don\"t know if she and her husband are humans or rabbits the rate they reproduce. Personally I think she overreacted.\" \"Well, who are we to judge? Neither of us ever reproduced offspring. Apparently you become quite attached to the little creatures. Think about that Lily Potter. She was to fond of her Harry she died for him. Silly people, parents. If they wanted something to care for an nurture I don\"t see why they couldn\"t just buy a plant or a goldfish. You hardly become attached to either of them the rate they crop it and are easily replaceable. With children you have to wait another nine months and if you don\"t like it you can\"t exchange it for another one.\" Bellatrix tutted. \"Waste of time. Only good for carrying on your family name but even then you get the black sheep like Sirius Black who refuse to act according to the family rules and decide to prevent the dark arts instead of embracing them.\" Voldemort smiled sympathetically. \"Luckily for me, I didn\"t have much of a family name apart from the horrendous Riddle family. Thankfully I quickly disposed of them without too much trouble. Unfortunately, I have no heirs. Not that they have much of a legacy to carry on but could you imagine being the son or daughter of the Dark Lord?\" \"Or spouse...\" Bellatrix whispered softly, looking at Voldemort. \"I always did admire you, you know. I loved how you looked to your goals and nothing, not attractions, not attachments would stand in the way of it. Even your soul was a worthy sacrificed. To be that dedicated really is something of a gift, though it\"s not a secret that you were a very gifted wizard, especially for one who wasn\"t pure blood.\" \"Yes, well, fortune favours the brave and all that. Tell me, just out of curiosity, are you still slightly mentally unstable or has that been cured during your rebirth?\" A twinkle in her eyes told him more than words ever could. \"I guess only time will tell,\" she said with an air of mystery that Voldemort had always found entrancing. She smiled sweetly. \"I have only been on earth again for around an hour. The only thing I really do know for sure is that you\"re here and following in steps I never thought would belong to you.\" \"Thems the breaks. Are you contracted?\" \"Mmm. Only for this episode. After this its my decision whether I stay here or class it as getting up from eternal slumber only as a toilet trip.\" He shifted position in his chair to get himself in a comfier posture. \"What do you think you\"ll do?\" \"I think I\"ll see what\"s going on up here. It\"s all so dull and dreary after a while when you\"re dead. It\"d be nice to be able to do a little bit of maiming to be honest. I\"ve missed that.\" Regretfully, Voldemort said, \"It\"s illegal to maim people. You get arrested for it.\" Bellatrix\"s eyes widened in surprise. \"No! Is this a new thing?\" \"No. Apparently it was illegal even during our rise to power. I tell you, they really should make these things clear. I mean the law today! If you don\"t sit down and research it it\"s just going to jump up and bite you when you least expect it. Do you know you can\"t even practice the darks arts on another person without a license?\" \"What\"s the world coming to?\" Bellatrix asked, shaking her head. \"I know,\" Voldemort agreed sympathetically. \"It\"s unfortunate. There\"s just no place for people like us in this world. It\"s far too civilized for our pseudo-savage ways. What, with no public executions, corporal punishment, children\"s movies where if you say the word \"blasted\" you get arrested, one can only imagine how kid\"s nowadays keep themselves entertained.\" \"Or don\"t, which is probably the case. Children are fat now. Did you see the porkers outside? Get rid of the ridiculous laws and you\"ll give them something to do again. After all, I remember back when I was just a little girl. I was thrilled at the very though of seeing a hanging. I would sprint all the way to the gallows and then sprint all the way back. It was healthy.\" Both sighing, they looked at each other. \"There\"s just no place in this unjust world for people like us,\" Voldemort said ruefully. \"Let\"s face it. People always do shun the great. We should just be grateful that its the brainless crowd don\"t know any better. They\"re just too thick to be able to process our ways.\" Remembering where he way, he quickly added, \"Of course, it goes without saying that this is excepting my viewers. They obviously have some worldly savvy about them. A sly smile spread across Bellatrix\"s blood red lips. \"Maybe they just need people to re-educate them. Teach them about the old ways, maybe even demonstrate them.\" There was a brief mental image of the old days. He was sitting at the head of a table with all his deatheaters around him, Bellatrix at his right hand side as always, smiling secretly to herself as if she knew something no one else did. Whenever it came to using action she would always be the first to get her hands dirty and gladly so. Nothing pleased her better than striking fear into the hearts of those who opposed them and causing suffering to those who stood against them. She really was quite devoted that way. \"Should we really be talking about this on live television?\" Voldemort questioned. \"After all, I\"m sure you\"re aware that many of our old enemies watch faithfully and I\"m not quite sure its because of the entertainment I provide.\" \"They\"re probably just jealous. I mean, what are all those little sprogs in Dumblesnore\"s Army doing with their lives now? Aurors, teachers, Ministry workers. Your typical mundane jobs. But you! You were back on the earth for less than five minutes and you already had your own talk show, you\"re a household name and everyone loves you. In fact, you\"ve probably gotten yourself more supporters now than when you did back in the Deatheater days!\" Her eyes widened as she realised something. \"In fact, I\"ll bet they\"re every bit as faithful as Deatheaters and then some, if you catch my drift.\" There was a huge uproar of applause to prove that what Bellatrix had said was entirely true. Whistles and whoops rang through the air, causing Voldemort to beam with pride. Those noises were made for him, to support him. Never had his name been so cheered in all his life. \"Bellatrix, I think you may just be on to something. Even after a years of lying under the soil you\"re mind is just as twisted and conniving as it had been when you were alive.\" She giggled like a school girl. \"Oh stop. You\"ll make me blush.\" \"No, I\"m serious. You know I don\"t kid.\" She did know he didn\"t kid. The last time some one had accused him of doing so the man had been vaporised in the blink of an eye. She always had loved the smell of burning flesh in the morning. Just as much as she liked the smell of daisies. \"So then, Master,\" She recrossed her legs and leaned in closer to him. \"What do you have in mind?\" He grinned coyly. \"How about we make like trees and leave this place. After which we\"ll congregate in mine. We have things to talk about, you and I.\" \"Indeed.\" Voldemort stood up, faced his audience and rubbed his hands together. \"Ladies, gentlemen and all magical creatures present. I regret to inform you that due to dastardly schemes being concocted in both my partner and I\"s heads, we\"ll have to call this show to a close early tonight. I will return next week and I guarantee you that it will blow your minds.\" Without wasting a second, he and Bellatrix disapperated in the flick of a wand leaving nothing behind them but two empty chairs and a contagious sense of scheming. Please review! jellybean-kitty This is the last chapter! Hope you guys all enjoy it! Just another little reminder. Please take this with a pinch of salt. It\"s not supposed to be serious:P The Final Guest This was it. The moment audiences all around the world - yes, indeed around the world - had been waiting for. Mass speculation and gossip (spread by the Daily Prophet with great pride) had all come down to this point. Who was the last guest on his show before he finished his contract? There had been rumours that it would be Harry Potter, flying in on the latest broomstick after doing auror work in Australia with enchanted bandicoots. There had also been rumours that (since people were being resurrected left right and centre in a plot line that won\"t be explained since there is no real explanation except to fit in with the story) Dumbledore would be the next guest. An even more incredulous rumour spoke of Tom Riddle Snr making a guest appearance to have a heart to heart with his estranged son. Alas, there had been no confirmation of any of these wild allegations. Until now. Voldemort grinned, a sight that twenty years ago would have made even the most happy of children cry their eyes up but now was a much loved and replicated expression. \"My dearest viewers, both live and at home. I\"m sure you\"re all dying to know about my next guest but first I have a message from security. Could the owner of the Nimbus 3000, license W!ZURD please move their broomstick off the double pink lines or it will be towed.\" There was shuffling in the audience and an audibly angry grumble from what sounded like a dwarf. \"Thanks for your patience. Could my next guest please join me. I\"ll give you a clue as to who he is. His first name rhymes with marry and his surname\"s a type of job.\" There was a huge uproar of applause and screams which quickly died down as the strange figure of an overweight middle aged man wearing a grease stained grey shirt appeared at the entrance. Voldemort groaned inwardly and gave the tech guy a look that would have made any mortal man scream. Larry, however, having just ate a pizza and was happily sedated by his cheese overload, was oblivious. \"Larry, don\"t you think you might be a little confused. You\"re not exactly who we\"re all expected.\" A light clicked on somewhere in that balding head. \"But you said a guy whose name rhymes with marry, right? Larry rhymes with marry. And a surname as a type of job. Well, my surname\"s cook!\" \"I meant Harry Potter you imbecile.\" A dejected looking Larry stepped to the side and behind him, wearing contact lenses instead of glasses and looked incredibly dashing, was Harry Potter. He gave the crowd a wave and all the females in the front rows fainted. Voldemort sniffed the air suspiciously and sensed a hint of \"Eau de Sex Bomb\", a recent invention of the Weasley Wizard Wheezes range of scents for him and her. Voldemort knew as he had just bought the same fragrance only last week. Then Harry turned to face Voldemort with a look so fierce electricity flew from his eyes. Voldemort made a mental note to tell Larry to make sure he fixed that loose cable behind Harry so such illusions weren\"t possible. Seriously, it made Harry look more threatening that what he really was. He knew. He had duelled him on several occasions and each time was surprised that the weedy little kid could put up such a fight. In all fairness, he was no longer weedy. He was well built, though not too musclular. The days of working as an auror in exotic places had tanned his face and what he could see of his arms and he had a rugged handsomeness that was reminiscent of his youth. Well, the youth that had returned to him. \"Now, now, Harry. Let\"s not meet as enemies but as-\" \"Cut the crap, Voldemort,\" Harry hissed. \"I\"m only playing this role so you\"ll let Ginny out of the broomstick cupboard.\" \"Oh really?\" Voldemort returned. \"And am I to believe that you just so happened to come by that scent by accident. Perhaps you mistook it for \"Eau de Self-Righteous Hypocrite\"?\" Harry looked confused. \"There\"s no such scent.\" \"I know. It was dry wit.\" \"Oh. I\"ve never really understood dry wit. I\"m a very literal guy.\" \"I see. But back to my original question. If you\"re so worried about Ginny and so reluctant to be here why are you wearing your finest and sporting an aftershave that would drive the audience wild? Am I to believe you just came across these things accidentally after we kidnapped your wife?\" Harry was silent for a few minutes. \"Yes.\" \"Well I don\"t believe you.\" \"Don\"t then.\" \"Fine.\" \"Fine.\" The two men said nothing for a full thirty seconds while the audience held their breath. Eventually, Voldemort broke their unspoken vow of silence. \"You know the whole world will think you\"re immature throwing a hissy fit like you are now. Seriously. Just because I might have killed your parents and various friends and then tried to kill you. Do you have to hold such a grudge. For God\"s sake get over it! It was more than twenty years ago when this whole thing started! For most of it you weren\"t even potty trained!\" There was moment of contemplation over this. Finally, Harry replied with, \"Geez, that is long ago. But I don\"t forgive you for what you\"ve done!\" \"I\"m not asking you to but if you want to be petty go right ahead. I\"ve got a chat show to host here and I can\"t very well do it if we\"re arguing like a bunch of school girls. So please. For the next however many minutes we have left can we just get along. Please?\" Harry looked at the hopeful audience and then rolled his eyes. \"I suppose so. Just until the end of this show.\" \"Good. Now I\"ve heard that you\"ve been a highly successful auror. Tell me about your recent exploits. Am I right in saying you\"ve just apparated in from Australia?\" \"Yeah, actually. I was in Melbourne over the past few weeks while I battled with hexed bandicoots. Some jaded ex-husband of a witch had cast a spell on all the bandicoots in their farm so that they breathed fire and flatulated poisonous gas. Personally I can\"t tell the difference between the two types of farts but there you go. He caused hundreds of galleons worth of damage but its okay. He\"s in custody now.\" \"I see. Must have been quite a challenge for you.\" \"Nah,\" Harry replied with a wave of his hand. \"I\"ve battled worse. I once had to single-handedly take on a whole flock of trolls who had been let loose by mistake on a village of muggles. I was actually on vacation at the time but when duty calls you know?\" \"I know.\" \"Plus with there being no Dark Wizards about anymore we\"re having to take on more menial jobs. I\"ve not had a proper dual on over a year. I\"ve had to act as a bodyguard to model Fleur Delacour which wasn\"t actually all that bad though I\"d have expected Bill to be there instead of me.\" \"And where was Bill?\" \"Babysitting.\" \"I see. Children, huh. Who would have them?\" \"I did!\" Harry replied indignantly. \"Well that\"s nice,\" Voldemort said, forcing a grin onto his face. \"For you. Personally, I don\"t have time for spawning from my loins. I\"m much to busy. That\"s not to say I don\"t partake in the pastime. I just make sure no consequences will result from it.\" \"Oh!\" Harry cried with sudden interest. \"You and Bellatrix, huh? Is she...you know...\" He grinned devilishly and made an ape-like noise. \"Better. She\"s...well...\" Voldemort impersonated a neigh which shot Harry\"s eyebrows up. \"Oh you dog.\" \"Tell me about it.\" \"No, you tell me about it.\" \"Very well. How about we go into more detail over a round of beer. My treat.\" \"When?\" \"After the show.\" Voldemort checked his watch. \"Actually, I\"ve another thing I wanted to talk to you about. Bellatrix and I have been...talking and we\"ve put together a little plan. I don\"t suppose you\"re interested?\" \"Explain,\" Harry asked in a voice that told Voldemort her was. \"First of all, how would you like to be worshipped like a God and have power beyond your wildest dreams?\" He leaned in and smirked. \"Together, we could rule the world.\" Harry\"s eyes widened. \"You don\"t mean-I mean you\"re not...Are you planning on building an army again?\" \"Lord no, Harry. I\"m talking about having a second season with you as my co-host. Interested?\" Grinning, Harry shook Voldemort\"s hand. \"You\"ve got yourself a deal. How\"s about a second round of beer on me and we can talk business.\" They stood up, turned to the audience and bowed deeply. \"Thank you very much for all your support. I will return for another season this time with Harry by my side. Join me then. Good night and God bless.\" He gestured for Harry to walk on before him and he followed for a few steps and then stopped. \"Oh! Harry?\" He called. \"Yeah?\" Harry called over his shoulder. \"Just one other thing.\" In the blink of an eye, Voldemort whipped out his wand. \"Avada Kedavra!\" Harry turned just in time to see the power spell be unleashed from his nemesis\" wand and fly in his direction. He squeezed his eyes shut and saw his life flash behind his eyelids. Then he frowned. He wasn\"t aware that there was what sounded like audience laughter all throughout his life. No, in fact he was certain there was no noise when Dumbledore died. He opened his eyes to find out what was happening to mess up his flashbacks and realised it was Voldemort\"s audience. They were laughing. Why were they laughing? He\"s just been killed by a fiendish wizard. What was funny about that? He looked down at his trousers to see if he had maybe wet himself in the process but he was dry as a bone. He looked to Voldemort for an explanation and saw that he too was chuckling."]}
